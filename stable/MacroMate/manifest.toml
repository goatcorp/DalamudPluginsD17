New Major Feature: Subscriptions

Subscriptions let you subscribe to a external macro
repository (typically hosted on git). Subscriptions provide a two-click
way to download the latest version of macros hosted externally, and will
automatically notify you when new updates are available (configurable).

Subscriptions only support vanilla macro features, subscription
repositories currently cannot add links or link conditions.

The primary use-case of this feature is to allow macro-using raiding
communities to quickly share macro changes, but other use case are
supported. Make sure to only subscribe to repositories you trust and
make sure to verify macros before you run them!
