changelog = """
- Subscription status window no longer auto-grows forever
- Made subscription job downloads Parallel (max 4 at a time), this
  significantly speeds up sync time for large subscriptions.
- Significantly improved caching of subscription macros, checking for
  updates is now much quicker and will only fully download a macro when
  changes have been made.
- Limited subscription jobs to 1 at a time (to prevent getting rate-limited by github).
- Made subscription loading spinners fancier
- Added 'Copy URL to Clipboard' action to subscriptions
