- Fixed?: Potential fix for crashes during cutscenes.

Version 0.6.0.0:
- Fixed: Breaking change in Tobii Game Integration API in version 3.4.1 of the Tobii Game Hub caused tracking of game window to fail. Plugin has switched over to the StreamEngine API.

- Some entities are not returning to normal after being highlighted by raycast detection.
- Entities highlighted by proximity are not returning to normal after no longer being the closest.
