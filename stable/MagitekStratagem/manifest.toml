Version 0.5.0.1:
 - BREAKING: Tobii Game Hub v3.4.1 fails to track window. Until fixed, this plugin won't work.
   To fix this, the plugin will attempt to load the API from v3.3.0, if its present on the system.
   Players who had the plugin work before Tobii Game Hub updated itself, should find it still works.
   Check "Plugins by Meoiswa" in the official Dalamud #plugin-help-forum section for more info.

Version 0.5.0.0:
 - Updated to API10

Version 0.4.2.0:
 - Fixed: Crashes when changing characters with RayCasting enabled.

Version 0.4.1.0:
 - Fixed: Overlay would render as a black window when using Dalamud multi-monitor windows.

Version 0.4.0.0:
 - New: Adding Calibration points to fine-tune tracking beyond what Tobii Game Hub allows.
 - Fixed: Circle Targetting on keyboard should now work properly.
 
 - ⚠️Experimental Plugin⚠️ merely a proof of concept.
 - Tobii Eyetracker integration for FFXIV.
 - Enables Gaze-at-object target aquisition. 
 - Supports overriding Tab Target (Enemy) and Soft Target (Target Cursor)
 - Works best for Gamepad users, but is compatible with KB&M
 - Requires Tobii Game Hub to be installed.
