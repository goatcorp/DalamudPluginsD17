Version 0.4.0.0:
 - New: Adding Calibration points to fine-tune tracking beyond what Tobii Game Hub allows.
 - Fixed: Circle Targetting on keyboard should now work properly.
 
 - ⚠️Experimental Plugin⚠️ merely a proof of concept.
 - Tobii Eyetracker integration for FFXIV.
 - Enables Gaze-at-object target aquisition. 
 - Supports overriding Tab Target (Enemy) and Soft Target (Target Cursor)
 - Works best for Gamepad users, but is compatible with KB&M
 - Requires Tobii Game Hub to be installed.
