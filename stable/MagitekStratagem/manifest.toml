Version 0.7.0.1:
- Fixed: If Tobii Game Hub is not present, the plugin isn't usable at all.

Version 0.7.0.0:
- Added: Support for Eyeware Beam Eye Tracker. Enables eye tracking with just a webcam.
- Fixed?: Potential fix for crashes during cutscenes.

Version 0.6.0.0:
- Fixed: Breaking change in Tobii Game Integration API in version 3.4.1 of the Tobii Game Hub caused tracking of game window to fail. Plugin has switched over to the StreamEngine API.
- Removed: Custom Calibration. Had to rip it out to get StreamEngine working again, sorry!

Known Issues:
- Windowed mode is currently unsupported due to the change to the new API.
- Some entities are not returning to normal after being highlighted by raycast detection.
- Entities highlighted by proximity are not returning to normal after no longer being the closest.
