Version 0.6.0.0:
  - Fixed: Breaking change in Tobii Game Integration API in version 3.4.1 of the Tobii Game Hub
  caused tracking of game window to fail. Plugin has switched over to the StreamEngine API.
  - Removed: Custom Calibration. Had to rip it out to get StreamEngine working again, sorry!

Known Issues:
  - Windowed mode is currently unsupported due to the change to the new API.
  - Some entities are not returning to normal after being highlighted by raycast detection.
  - Entities highlighted by proximity are not returning to normal after no longer being the closest.
