Version 3.2.0.0:
 - New Tilt option: Mapping. When this setting is enabled, the Camera Tilt will be set to a value between the "Enabled" and "Disabled"
  values based on the Enabled and Disabled Camera Distances. This allows you to have a different tilt angle depending on how far the camera is zoomed out.
