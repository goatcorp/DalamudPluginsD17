[TF2-ish Critical Hits]
- Add option per job to set a minimum time between sounds.
  - For example, if you set the time as 1000 ms and a critical hit sound is played,
  no other sound (be it for critical hit, direct hit, critical heal etc.) will be played for the next second.
  - Keep it at 0 ms to use the current behavior.
(Thanks to Grayve for the idea and everyone at the Discord thread for the feedback!)
