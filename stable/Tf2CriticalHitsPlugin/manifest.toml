[TF2-ish Critical Hits]
- Game SFX combobox now adapts its size to the ImGui font size (Thanks, Neh!).

[Countdown Jams]
- Now, it's possible to have multiple Jams to play for the same countdown (Thanks, GokaiSanyu!).
  - For this, any Jams other than the first must be configured to play at a specific mark.
  - Only the first Jam's cancel sound will play if the countdown is cancelled.
- Fix volume sliders changing simultaneously.
- The numeric inputs now adapt their sizes to the ImGui font size (Thanks, Neh!).
