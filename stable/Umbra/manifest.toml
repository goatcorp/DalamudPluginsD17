# Umbra 2.2.35

## New Additions

- Added "tags" to all built-in widgets that allow you to search for them in the "Add widget" window. Please note that tags are deliberately defined in English only to make it easier to direct users to the correct widgets via support channels.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Teleport widget: Replaced the "Open favorites by default" checkbox with a selection option that allows you to choosebetween "Current expansion", "Favorites" and "Miscellaneous" (by [alexpado](https://github.com/alexpado)). Note that if you previously had the "Open favorites by default" option enabled, you will need to re-enable it in the new selection.
