# Umbra 2.2.34

## New Additions

- Added an **Icon Picker** for "Font-Awesome" icons (the ones you see in the icon-button widgets, such as Volume, Marker Control, Battle Effects, etc.)
- Added Icon customization options to all widgets that have static icons.
- Added an indicator to the Emote List widget's emote picker window that indicates whether an emote is already present on the panel.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Fixed the "Copy" and "Paste" buttons that went missing in 2.2.33 from widget instance settings windows.
- Disabled the "Configure" option on Separator entries in the Dynamic Menu widget.
- Increased the height of Separators in the Dynamic Menu widget to make it easier to right-click them.
