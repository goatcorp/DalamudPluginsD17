# Umbra 2.2.31

## New Additions

- Volume Control Widget: Added buttons to toggle whether audio channels continue to play while the game is in the background. The master channel toggles the "Play sounds when window is not active" setting.
- Coordinates widget: Added a "two-label" option that condenses the widget by showing the X and Y values as two separate smaller labels.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Shortcut Panel: Added support for all `/micon` variants. Big thanks to Haselnussbomber for making this possible!
- Stacked Clock: Let the bottom clock use the same text color as the top one.
