# Umbra 2.2.4

## New Additions

- Added a search box to the "Add Widget" and "Widget Settings" windows.
- Added a world marker type for Treasure Coffers.
- Added a "show coordinates" option to the Location Widget. Note that this _replaces_ the district name when enabled in order to keep things condensed.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Fixed a 'popup-open' sound being played even though a widget button is disabled.
- Fixes in German translations for Aether Currents & Sightseeing Log Vistas (by [Bloodsoul](https://github.com/Bloodsoul)).
- Hide the Job Name in gearset switcher popup buttons when the gearset name is equal to the job name.
