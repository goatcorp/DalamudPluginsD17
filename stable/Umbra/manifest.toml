# Umbra 2.3.1

## New Additions

- Dynamic Menu Widget: Add support for alt-labels & icon color masks in "Custom Entry" items, (By [Ivinedra](https://github.com/Ivinedra)).

## Fixes & Improvements

- Updated the icon picker library. SE has shuffled/removed some icons, which caused the icon picker to misbehave.
