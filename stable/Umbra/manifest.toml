# Umbra 2.1.9

This is a small update that addresses some issues with the previous release.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Fixed some widgets appearing to be non-interactable due to a neighboring widget overlapping them with an invisible box.
- Fixed party member markers showing up in the game world when they shouldn't.
- Fixed an issue where the text of some world markers did not render correctly in French.
- Fixed the "auto-close popup" option for the gearset switcher.
