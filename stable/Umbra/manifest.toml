# Umbra 2.2.23

## New Additions

- Added Food Buttons to the "Companion" widget that allows you to feed your Chocobo with different types of food. The visibility of these buttons can be toggled on or off in the settings window of this widget.
- Added a right-click option to the "Teleport" widget to open the vanilla teleport window.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Fixes wrong translations of "Item" to "Artikel" instead of "Gegenstand". (By [Haselnussbomber](https://github.com/Haselnussbomber))
- Fix the way the maximum rank of Societal Relations are displayed, which should now correctly show Allied vs Bloodsworn based on progression. (By [Haselnussbomber](https://github.com/Haselnussbomber))
- Fix pseudo cutscenes during combat not working for the "in cutscene" visibility checks. (By [Bloodsoul](https://github.com/Bloodsoul))
