# Umbra 2.2.6

## A gift to all the role-playing enthusiasts

This update adds a new "Emote List" widget, providing quick and easy access to a customizable grid of emotes.

The widget supports up to four categories with customizable names, presented as "tabs." The tab strip is hidden if only one category is enabled (_default_). Each tab contains a grid of 8x4 assignable slots, offering a total of 32 buttons per tab, or a _whopping_ 128 slots in total. Right-clicking a slot opens a context menu, allowing you to access the "Emote Picker" or clear the selected slot.

Enjoy!

## Additional Improvements & Fixes

- Fixed the missing translations of the "default widget settings" that came with the last update.
- Fixed a crash that could occur when an invalid Icon ID was selected in one of the widget configuration windows.
