# Umbra 2.3.8

## New Additions

- Added an option to hide the "Lv. XXX" text from gearset buttons in the Gearset Switcher widget for jobs with capped levels.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Dynamically resize the popup width of the Custom Deliveries widget based on the amount of bonus icons shown.
- Fixed the default "Max level indicator" text color. It wasn't supposed to look pink.
- Split the location widget text into 2 lines when visiting the company workshop and the "Show district label" option is turned on.
