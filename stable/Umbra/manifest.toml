# Umbra 2.2.3

## New Additions

- Added a "Collection Item Button" widget that allows placing a button on your toolbar for quick access to a collection item.
- Added a world marker type for "Sightseeing Log Vistas" that you have yet to complete.
- Added dynamically changing mouse cursors for interactive elements.
- Added cooldown timers in the travel menu for items and the Return action.
- Added an option to the Clock widget that allows vertical adjustments of the prefix label/symbol.
- Added an option to change the job icon type of the party member world markers.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Fixed minimized window state not taking UI scale into consideration, causing cut-offs in the titlebar height.
- Fixed the check whether your Chocobo companion can actually be summoned.
- Improved the window clipping system to better determine the outer bounds of native game windows that can overlap Umbra's windows.
- Added support for outline colors (UIGlow) for the server info bar entries.
