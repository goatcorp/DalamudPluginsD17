# Umbra 2.2.11

## New Additions

- Add an option to the Flag widget that allows you to send a chat message on _middle-mouse click_ with the flags coordinates.
  - A configurable chat prefix is _required_, for example: `/p My flag is at`. See the Flag widget settings window for more information.
  - You cannot send more than 1 message every 3 seconds.
  - This feature is mainly intended for hunt/fate train conductors

## Fixes & Improvements

- Disabled the toolbar sliding animation when Dalamud's "Multi-monitor support" is enabled, since this seems to cause significant drops in FPS for some users due to the toolbar being physically pushed off-screen.
- Did some preliminary work for a future custom deliveries widget.
