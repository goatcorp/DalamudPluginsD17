# Umbra 2.2.2

## Behavioral changes

- The "Enabled" state of World Markers is now `Disabled` by default. This means that newly added world marker types aren't suddenly enabled automatically anymore. If you find world markers suddenly missing, please re-enable them either from the settings window or the world markers control widget.

## New Additions

- Added a minimize/restore button to Umbra Windows.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Fixed the French translation for "Retainer".
- Fixed a crash that may occur when switching zones due to the Aether Current world marker factory trying to read from protected memory.
