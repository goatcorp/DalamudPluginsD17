# Umbra 2.2.32

## New Additions

- Added a **Dynamic Menu** widget that is meant to be a successor of the "Custom Menu" widget. This one allows adding the same types of entries to be added like the ones from the Shortcut panel widget, as well as a "Custom entry" that has the same options as the existing Custom Menu / Button widgets. You can right-click items in this menu to start customizing.
- Added a centralized place for number formatting that allows you to specify a custom decimal- and thousands separator in the General Settings category in the Settings window. All widgets showing numeric values will adhere to these options.
- Added an "icon size" option to all toolbar widgets that use the "Icon Button Widget" base (volume, markers control, plugin list, battle effects, etc.)

## Fixes & Improvements

- Fixed a potential crash that might occur when restarting the plugin from the settings window while the appearance tab is active.
- Fixed an issue where select (dropdown) input controls were no longer visible when opening the settings window for the second time.
- The Unified Main Menu widget will now hide the avatar image if the icon id is set to 0.
- Streamlined all icon button widgets (volume, markers control, plugin list, battle effects) to all share the same configuration options.

## Additional changes for developers

- The window system is no longer internal and can be used by plugin authors.
- Input control nodes are no longer internal and can be used by plugin authors.
- A generic "VariablesWindow" has been added that allows creating windows that show a list of categorized input controls for an arbitrary list of variables. The new Dynamic Menu widget uses this to allow users editing custom menu entries. A future update will replace the Widget Settings window with this variant as well.
- A new "FormatNumber" method has been added to "I18N". This method allows formatting a number that complies with user settings for decimal- and thousands separators.
