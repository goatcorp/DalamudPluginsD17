# Umbra 2.3.2

## Fixes & Improvements

- Re-added some missing icons to the Icon Picker (By [Bloodsoul](https://github.com/Bloodsoul)).
- Fixed a text-rendering issue in Vista world markers (by [Haselnussbomber](https://github.com/Haselnussbomber)).
- Fix black bar on multi monitor if it spans larger than the monitor (By [wolfcomp](https://github.com/wolfcomp)).
- Replaced all occurrences of `.ToDalamudString().TextValue` with `.ExtractText()` to make string conversion more consistent across the plugin.
