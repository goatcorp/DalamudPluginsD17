# Umbra 2.2.15

## Shortcut Panel

Have you ever found yourself in need of more hotbars for things that aren't job-related? This update introduces a new widget, the "**Shortcut Panel**", which is effectively an additional hotbar (panel). It looks similar to the Emote widget but instead of only being capable of holding emotes, it can contain a whole bunch of stuff, including items from your inventory, mounts, minions, stored macros, and even shortcuts to your commonly used crafting recipes.

The panel allows you to customize the amount of rows and columns, up to a maximum of 16. Similar to the "Emote List" widget, it also supports up to 4 categories. This means that a single category can hold a maximum of 256 slots, or 1024 over all 4 categories in total.

-# Although this widget shares similarities to the Emote List widget, this widget is meant to be a _general purpose_ widget, meaning it does not have any type-specific settings. It is _not_ designed for customization of names, icon colors, or any other type-specific settings like toggling the option to send emotes to chat for example.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Added "Looking to Meld" & "Looking for Party" statuses to the "Online Status" widget.
- Fixed the Societal Relations widget automatically expanding in width when a custom UI scale was used.
- Fixed an issue in the drawing library where the "gap" between nodes did not take custom UI scale into account.
- Fixed the "Main Menu Button" popups not syncing properly.
- Fixed a couple of minor translation issues.

-# This is a rather large update, meaning it may take a little while for it to become available.
