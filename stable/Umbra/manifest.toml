# Umbra 2.2.10

## New Additions

- Added a context menu with a "Teleport to nearby Aetheryte" action to the Societal Relations widget.
- Added a separate font configuration option for World Markers. This one defaults to Dalamud's default font. You can customize world marker fonts in the Appearance tab.
- Added an option to the "Unified Main Menu" widget that allows you to change the banner color from "Window Accent", "Job role color" or "None".
- Added an option to the "Unified Main Menu" widget in which you can specify the way your character's name is drawn (full name, first name, last name or initials)

## Fixes & Improvements

- Increased the maximum amount of entries in the Custom Menu widget to 24 (from 16)
- Fixed Multi-Monitor support for World Markers and the toolbar.
- Fixed broken toolbar and marker positions when the game is running in windowed mode.
- Updated the Sightseeing Log Vista markers for the new Dalamud version (_Please restart your game if you haven't already done so!_)
