# Umbra 2.2.26

## New Additions

- Added an FPS counter widget. I know there are plugins that already add an FPS counter to the server info bar. However, since you can't set a fixed width for individual entries in this widget, I've decided to add one that does allow size customization to ensure your toolbar doesn't freak out when you're bouncing between 99 ~ 100 FPS.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Set the default value of "Use the Game's mouse cursor" to false to keep the original behavior by default.
- Reworked the way world markers are rendered to be much more efficient. Instead of continuously creating and destroying graphical nodes to render, the system now uses a "pool" of 255 "slots" that can host up to 3 world markers, depending on your distance aggregation settings. This also fixes a memory leak that the old system had that would eventually lock up the system because the garbage collector had to free up a couple of gigabytes of memory every now and then.
