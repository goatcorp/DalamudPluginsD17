# Umbra 2.2.27

## New Additions

- Added a "Sanctuary Indicator" widget that simply shows a little moon icon whenever you are in a sanctuary. The widget hides itself when you are not in a sanctuary.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Fixed an error that made it seem like you're adding 10-20 of the same widget instances when you add a new widget until you restarted Umbra. This error occured only when you opened and closed the settings window multiple times prior to adding a new widget. This was a side effect of an event listener that was still attached to disposed resources that are now properly disposed of since the last update.
