# Umbra 2.2.21

## New Additions

- Added an **Ornaments picker** to the Shortcut Panel widget.
- Added an **Extra Commands** picker to the Shortcut Panel widget (for gpose, idle cam and alarm).

## Improvements & Fixes

This update only contains a refactor of the underlying system of the shortcuts panel widget, which now introduces a
"provider" system that makes it easier to add new shortcut-types in the future. Besides the two new additions, you
shouldn't notice any changes in the UI or functionality.
