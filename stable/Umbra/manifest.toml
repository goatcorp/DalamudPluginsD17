# Umbra 2.2.16

## New Additions

- Added a "Key Item Picker" to the "Shortcut Panel" widget. This means that you can now pin your Wondrous Tails book to your shortcut panel, amongst other things.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Added _partial_ support for custom icons set via `/micon` and `/macroicon` in stored macros. Gearset icons and ID's (from SimpleTweaks' Extended Macro Icon tweak) are now picked up by the shortcut panel widget.
- Implemented shared clip-region support for DelvUI. This should make sure that DelvUI no longer intercepts mouse clicks when an Umbra widget or window is on top of a DelvUI element.
- Fixed correct macros not being selected correctly from the Macro picker in the shortcut panel widget.
- Fixed the Societal Relations widget from growing horizontally while UI scale is < 100.
- Fixed the bottom padding (or lack thereof) of the shortcut panel widget.
