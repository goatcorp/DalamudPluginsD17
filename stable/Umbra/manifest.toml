# Umbra 2.2.33

## New Additions

- Replaced all "Icon ID" input fields with an **Icon Picker**. Clicking on this type of control will open a new Icon Picker window that shows categorized icons. You can still use a custom icon ID by specifying it in the "Icon ID" input field in the icon picker window if the icon you are looking for is not in the default categorized sets.
- Added a "Horizontal Padding" option to Icon Button Widget types. This allows you to increase the width of icon buttons in case you've disabled decorations.

## Fixes & Improvements

- The **Plugin List Widget** now adheres to default icon button widget settings.
