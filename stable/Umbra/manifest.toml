# Umbra 3.1.0

## Fixes & Improvements

- Updated Umbra for compatibility with Dalamud API 13. (By [wolfcomp](https://github.com/wolfcomp)).
- Reintroduce "Expansion List Position"-option for the Teleport menu widget in condensed layout mode.
- Hide empty groups and columns in the gearset switcher to preserve a stable layout.
- Attempt on fixing some flickering issues when Widgets use the "Text Only" display mode.

## Known issues

This version is a preliminary release to get Umbra working with the latest Dalamud version. Expect
some things to still not work properly at the time of this release:

- Closing widget popups by clicking next to them is currently not working.
- Some game icons are not rendering, most notably macro icons in the shortcut panel and dynamic menu widgets.

These issues should resolve themselves as Dalamud itself is progressing further through this patch.
