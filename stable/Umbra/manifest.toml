# Umbra 2.2.22

- Added numbers and colored rank names in the societal relations widget.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Reworked the TextDecoder (by [Haselnussbomber](https://github.com/Haselnussbomber)).
- Updated almost a lot of German translations(by [Haselnussbomber](https://github.com/Haselnussbomber))
- Removed the "C" rank mobs from the Hunt World Markers settings, because C rank mobs are imaginary.
