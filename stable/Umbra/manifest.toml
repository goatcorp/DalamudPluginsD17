# Umbra 2.2.20

## New Additions

- Added a **Miscellaneous** category to the "Teleport" widget.
- Added a "Hide in Cutscenes" option to the Auxiliary Bar. This option takes precedence over the other conditional visibility settings.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Ensure the server info bar doesn't cause a crash anymore if another plugin sets their entry text to NULL.
- Fixed an issue causing a crash-to-desktop when the Duty Recorder Widget was added to the toolbar.
