# Umbra 2.2.30

## New Additions

- Added a **Stacked Clock** widget. I've decided to add this as a separate widget since the options this one provides would otherwise severely conflict with features of the existing clock widget. This one also allows you to define custom time formats.
- Added a standalone **Coordinates** widget that shows your coordinates on the current map.
- Added a configurable center point to the world marker's compass system.
- Added an option to Hide the Auxiliary bar when your weapon is drawn.
- Added the ability to right-click the mute buttons of individual channels in the volume widget popup.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Location Widget: Switch to "Single label" mode if sub-label (district or coordinates) is empty to ensure the text is centered properly in all situations.
