# Umbra 2.2.29

## Fixes & Improvements

- Removed excessive padding on most widgets in non-decorative mode. This will move most widgets closer to each other. If this bothers you, either increase the item spacing in toolbar settings, or increase the "Horizontal button padding" in the widgets to increase the spacing. Note that this change only affects widgets that have decorations turned off.
- Fixed the minimum icon ID limit of 14 on the shortcut panel. This was clearly a bug and not an intended "limitation".
