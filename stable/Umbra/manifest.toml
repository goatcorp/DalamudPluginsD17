# Umbra 2.2.0

## New Additions

- Added world markers for Aether Currents. Note that you need to be within 100 yalms for these to show up and have completed the necessary quest requirements.
- Added a new widget "Retainers" that shows a list of your retainers and their status. Note that this widget disables itself if you are not on your home world or in an instanced duty.
- Added an option to the Item Button to automatically hide itself when the configured item is not (or no longer) in your inventory.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Fixed disposal of resources when unloading or restarting the plugin. (Big thanks to Hasel & Wildwolf!)
