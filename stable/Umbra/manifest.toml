# Umbra 2.2.9

## Societal Relations

This update introduces a _preliminary version_ of the "Societal Relations" (previously known as Beast Tribes) widget. This widget displays an overview of your current standing with unlocked beast tribes, as well as how many of the associated currency you have with them.

I would like to reiterate that this is a _preliminary release_, which means that more features will be added in the near future, including but not limited to: option to teleport to a nearby Aetheryte and custom colors to better indicate your rank.

You can click on a society to "pin" it to the toolbar, similar to how the Currencies widget works.

## New additions

- Added a right-click action to the "Emote List" widget to open the vanilla Emote List window.
- Added tooltips to server info bar entries.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Fixed the Sightseeing Log Vista markers for the current release version of Dalamud (with forward compatibility to the next release)
- Fixed the Item Level sync option in the gearset switcher not working honoring the toggle option for it.
