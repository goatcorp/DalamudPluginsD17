# Umbra 2.2.7

## Need more space?

This update introduces the "**Unified Main Menu**" widget, which consolidates all main menu buttons into a single uniform widget, which almost looks like the Windows Start Menu. It even has a little modifiable avatar picture shown in the header like the old Windows XP days. The button itself is fully customizable, similar to the custom button.

You can "pin" your favorite entries to the main menu itself for quick & easy access. Right-click on any (non-disabled) entry to bring up the context menu which allows you to pin and unpin items. Pinned items can be sorted from their context menus as well.

## Additional Improvements & Fixes

- Fixed missing translations in the Experience Bar widget (by [Bloodsoul](https://github.com/Bloodsoul)).
