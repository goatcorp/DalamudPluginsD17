## Known issues

This version is a preliminary release to get Umbra working with the latest Dalamud version. Expect
some things to still not work properly at the time of this release:

- Closing widget popups by clicking next to them is currently not working.
- Some game icons are not rendering, most notably macro icons in the shortcut panel and dynamic menu widgets.

These issues should resolve themselves as Dalamud itself is progressing further through this patch.
