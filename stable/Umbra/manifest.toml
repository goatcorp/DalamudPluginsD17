# Umbra 2.2.37

## New Additions

- Added a "Hide threshold" to the FPS counter widget to automatically hide itself if the current FPS is above a set limit.
- Added a "Label" option to the FPS counter widget for the "FPS"-text that appears next to the counter.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Prevent an error while in Deep Dungeons due to the World Marker system attempting to access a zone while none is available.
- Show the correct "Deep Dungeon Level" as synced level in the Experience Bar widget.
- Whether the Sanctuary Icon is shown on the location widget no longer relies on your character having Glamour abilities unlocked.
