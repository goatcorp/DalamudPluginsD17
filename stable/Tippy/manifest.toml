### New Features
- Adds Bonzi, F1, Genie, Genius and Rover as new agents. Agents can be switched in the settings window.
- Clicking on an agent will play a random animation.
- Adds support for branching/layered animations.
- Categorises animations so that each agent can be sad at you for not parsing high enough.

### Fixes
- Configuration should be saved even if the game/plugin crashes.
- Agents will play an animation when first loading or when switched in/out.
- Fixed a crash when a sound file could not be found.
