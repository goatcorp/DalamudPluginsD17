changelog = "v3.4.x - Hello guys! I've made some adjustments and tested many things and i think it is in a "releasable" state.

- BattleTalk overlays are disabled completely for the moment (there is some issue with concurrency that needs fixing)
- TalkSubtitle (the cutscenes texts) are disabled due to the need of more testing"
