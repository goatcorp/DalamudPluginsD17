- Fixed flag tooltips
- Priority is now verbosely displayed
- You can now optionally manually specify priority
- Now using simplified priority calculation, to make custom priority easier to work with
- List will now sort by priority
1.2.3
- Fixed Some bugs when easing from the no-target state to new targets, and from the switching state to the no-target state. Note that going from the no-target state to the new-target state is unfixed
- Added animation options for the no-target state
1.2.4
- Bugfix so that lines which are entirely behind the camera will now always cull
1.2.5
- Fixed issue where job flags would only apply correctly when an entity was first initialized
- Using job flags will now result in that rule having a slightly higher priority when using auto priority
1.2.6
- Various minor optimizations (Should negligibly improve performance in crowded areas)
- Added the ability to share presets
- Fixed minor memory leak when turning plugin on-and-off-and-on repeatedly
