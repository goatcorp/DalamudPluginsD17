- You can now optionally manually specify priority
- Now using simplified priority calculation, to make custom priority easier to work with
- List will now sort by priority
1.2.3
- Fixed Some bugs when easing from the no-target state to new targets, and from the switching state to the no-target state. Note that going from the no-target state to the new-target state is unfixed
- Added animation options for the no-target state
1.2.4
- Bugfix so that lines which are entirely behind the camera will now always cull
