changelog = """
- UI occlusion now checks for line intersections, so there should no longer be segments appearing if it's rect overlaped a UI element, but did not intersect it under certain circumstances
- Fixed a bug which would cause the end cap to have the wrong opacity when 'Fade to End' is enabled
- Adjusted the rendering of the end caps so they appear uniform
- Fixed issue where the first/third person transition for lines which target or source the player would appear disjointed
- Minor optimizations in the broad phase of UI occlusion
