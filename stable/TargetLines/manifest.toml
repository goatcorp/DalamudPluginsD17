changelog = """1.2.7
- Improved the rendering of fancy lines, now they should look less looney when they clip the camera
- Improved visibility logic
- Improved logic relating to intangible game objects (ghost lines should no longer appear)
- Set default sample count for fancy lines to an odd number (should give the line a middle point with the default config)
- Made visibility check on Game Objects less aggresive
- Introduced a regression, where the sample count for lines is only applied when the line is constructed
