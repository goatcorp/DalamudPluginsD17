Bug fixes:
- Fix various cases which could cause null reference exceptions.
- Fixed an issue where dead, and non-yet-rendered entities could have target lines.
- Fixed an issue where it was possible to have an out of bounds exception with dynamic-sample-count fancy lines.
- Significantly simplified the management of individual lines, improving stability reducing heap usage.

Enhancements:
- UI Occlusion now uses clip rects, resulting in a performance improvement. Additionally, UI Occlusion now supports legacy lines.
- Minor logic improvement to target line behavior.
- Lines now get reinitialized when settings are modified.
- Additional tooltips added.

Other:
- Removed HelliTri test
- Random changes to dx11 tests
