Bug fixes:
- Fixed an issue where the plugin would output an error in regards to the focus target when logging out with a focus target. Additionally, fixed an issue with the focus target line respawning on a dead entity.
- Added some LOD options which may improve performance at no visual cost: "Use ScreenSpace LOD" and "View Angle Sampling".
Known Issues:
- After logging into a character, returning to the title screen may cause target lines to not appear on all entities. This can be fixed by restarting the plugin.
