changelog = """- Better countdown cancellation logic
- Duty name instead of zone name for recording folders (e.g., "Arcadion Light-heavyweight M4" instead of "The Arcadion")
- Stop recording on zone exit - useful when you kill a boss and there's a cutscene after
- Start replay buffer when recording starts - keeps both running together"""
