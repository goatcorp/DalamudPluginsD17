changelog = """
New Features
- added `/phcam on` and `/phcam off` commands which toggle the behavior of the plugin
- `/phcam` will still toggle the config window, however, `/phcam config` will show the config window
- By popular demand, reintroduced the WASDEQ (keybind) movement method from earlier versions of HybridCamera. If you are one of the people who wanted this, toggle the new 'Keybind Mode' option on

Bugfixes
- Fixed unlikely but possible circumstance where the smart strafe hook could overwrite itself without disposing, which would cause a crash

Other
- Slightly improved the appearance of the config window
