- Valuable dyes are now factored into the item selection process when applying plates
  - Previously, the selection process was all or nothing. It will now attempt to find a match with a valuable dye, or an item with any matching dye first
- Dyes on items already in the current plate will no longer be ovewritten and waste a dye
- Plates should now always fully apply and refresh on first try

For troubleshooting, please enable Troubleshooting mode (Settings -> Troubleshooting mode), reproduce the issue, then post any log line from `/xllog` starting with `[Troubleshooting]`. Thanks!
