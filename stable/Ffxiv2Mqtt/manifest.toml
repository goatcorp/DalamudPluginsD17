changelog = """Updated for 6.5.
Added the option to display subscriptions with Dalamud Toasts.
BREAKING CHANGE: I messed up your output channel for custom subscriptions, but made sure I won't have to again in the future. Just go back into the menu, change them back to what you wanted and click Save to fix."""
