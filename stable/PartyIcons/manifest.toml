changelog = """
Changed the way the game's nameplates are accessed
- This allows a newly started ACT to still find the chat log after loading the plugin

Added setting to toggle role assignment based on party chat (by hmm-norah)
- e.g. saying 'h1' to be assigned H1 (or 'mt' to be assigned MT)

Cleaned up settings UI
- Added section headers and formatting
- Moved chat name settings to their own tab
- Various other adjustments
- This should help finding what you need and experimenting with different combinations
