**Added**
 - Undercut fallback setting added, this allows you to ignore NQ/HQ pricing if there are no listings available for NQ/HQ

**Fixes**
 - When listing an item and the only listings were your own, it was possible for the cache to not update(making all the listings still list as stale)
 - When listing an item for the first and the only listings were your own the cache was not getting updated
