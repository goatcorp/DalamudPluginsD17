### Added
- Added debug windows available for end-users when debugging specific issues
- Added a /amconfig command for opening the configuration window
- If undercutting has to fall back to the NQ price a small tooltip will be displayed making it more obvious to the end user why the price was used

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug if the current sales CSV fails to parse correctly
- Fixed a bug where a retainer that you owned's listings would be ignored
- Fixed how the arrow buttons were rendered
- Changing the date in the sales summary should update the list instantly instead of needing a reorder
