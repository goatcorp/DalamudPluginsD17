changelog = """
- Removed check box to enable 'Estinien Must Die'
- Difficulties selectable with a combo selection : 'Sprout', 'Wyrm Hunter' (default), 'Estinien Must Die'
- New difficulty mode "Sprout" :
  - Dropping your GCD will increase the decay rate of the progress gauge instead of demoting you.
  - Duties performance are not recorded for jobs in Sprout mode
- Added a 3s delay before the demotion warning starts if you just have been demoted.
- Increased the configurable range limit to determine if a GCD was dropped from 1 s to 2.5 s
