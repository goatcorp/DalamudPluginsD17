# NeatNoter 2.6.1

## Features

- Created a word count when editing notes, which also display a small warning about performance drop on long notes.
- Created the option to set a note as an overlay, which has very little UI elements and should be more performatic for duties.

If any bug if found, please report at: https://github.com/shadowkras/NeatNoter/issues/2
