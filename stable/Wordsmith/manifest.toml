changelog = """# Wordsmith v1.8.2 Patch Notes

# New Features:
  * Setting thesaurus history size to 0 will now be unlimited.

# UI Changes:
  * Fixed the strange column sizing in the help window on the `Roleplaying` tab.
  * Removed setting to change enter key behavior.
  * Advanced setting panel in the `Marks & Tags` secion now scales with the amount of content rather than just being a certain size.
  * `When OOC is` column of advanced marker settings is now fixed width.
  * `Max Text Length` option changed from `SlideInt` to `DragInt` to allow typing desired value.

# Bugs Fixed:
  [FIXED] Custom markers copying unusable data to clipboard
  [FIXED] Changing chat header doesn't update text until after a text change.
  [FIXED] Copying history item copies the wrong data.
  [FIXED] Searching a word in the Thesaurus that is currently in history will declare the search as failed.
  [FIXED] Searching the same word with different capitalization counted as an entirely different word.
  [FIXED] Thesaurus keeping one too few search history items.
  [FIXED] Chunk markers defined as `Before OOC` were appearing after `Before Body` in the list.

# Technical Stuff:
  * Found a redundancy in a method that caused extra CPU time.
  * Made a change to the way chunk generation is handled so that chunk generation will always happen in the `Update()` method to ensure that it is never run multiple times in a single frame.
  * Removed the setting for enter key behavior. This setting has been obsolete for a while now.
  * Increased the maximum possible value of `Max Text Length` for scratch pads."""
