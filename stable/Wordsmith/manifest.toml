changelog = """New Features:
    [X] Using the command /scratchpad {id} with a deleted ID will now create a new pad with the recycled ID.
    [X] Using the command /scratchpad {id} with an unused ID will now create a new pad with the new ID (yes, /scratchpad 42069 works).
    [X] Named Scratch Pads! You can now use /scratchpad followed by any name you want to create a pad with a custom tag that will even show in the settings window.
    [X] Added a notice system to tell users about the new features and things. (Can be disabled in Settings General tab.)

UI Changes:
    [X] Open Scratch Pads table moved to a child frame with its own scrollbar.
    [X] Open Scratch Pads table now has a "Hide" button for visible pads where the "Show" button appears for hidden pads.
    [X] Updated message box/error alert behavior. Alerts/Message Boxes will now display centered in the screen and cannot be moved or folded.
    [X] Message boxes now automatically size themselves.
    [X] SettingsUI Open Scratch Pads "Chat Header" column renamed to "Description".
    [X] SettingsUi now has a "General" section.

Bug Fixes:
    [X] The "Close" button in Settings for open pads will now use the "Confirm Scratch Pad Delete" configuration option.
    [X] Fixed a loop issue that caused loading web manifest and dictionary files to always try three times instead of stopping at the first successful attempt.
    [X] Fixed a bug that could cause Confirm Delete Scratchpads setting to be accidentally changed.

Technical Stuff:
    [X] Refactored DebugUI.cs in a way that has compressed the code down and made it easier to read and understand.
    [X] Removed obsolete interface.
    [X] Removed unnecessary methods ShowResetDictionary() and ShowRestoreSettings() which were just wrapper methods for ShowMessageBox()
    [X] Restructured Rect struct to accomodate more uses.
    [X] Added a GetWindowName() method to several windows to prevent window naming errors.
    [X] Refactored extension methods GetProperties(...) and Dump(...) to use obj instead of obsolete interface IReflected
    [X] Updated the Wordsmith.cs header comment.
    [X] Refactored WordsmithUI.AddWindow(Window?) to alleviate a bug that could result in adding an already existing window if the window_lock was disabled.
    [X] WordsmithUI.CleanWindowList() should now abort while windows are locked."""
