New features:
* Added a configuration option to enable or disable the tooltip window.
* Added a configuration option to enable or disable the tooltip window during duties. By default, the RPP tooltip window is now hidden while in a duty instance.
* Added the /rpp slash command to control the plugin. Supported options: /rpp edit, /rpp profile, /rpp config, /rpp show, /rpp hide, /rpp duty show, /rpp duty hide.
* Logged in users should now remain logged in indefinitely. In case a login session does expire because the game wasn't launched for a year, the plugin will detect this and offer to log in again.

Bug fixes:
* Fixed a bug where the tooltip window got stuck at "Retrieving profile..." under Linux if Wine was configured to identify as Windows 10, as it does since XIVLauncher Core 1.0.4.

Known issues:
* The plugin is still currently region-locked to Europe because that's the only region allowed by its backing website, Chaos Archives. This will be fixed in a future update.
