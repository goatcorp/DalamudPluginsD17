## Adoption of XIVCombo
- <:croissant:>
- A new UI, more modern and more fitting for the increasing amount of jobs has been added to XIVCombo.
- Currently, all 65 existing combos have been kept while keeping feature parity as much as possible.
- Your previous settings will not carry over this new version. A welcoming pop-up will warn you about it.
- No new features, except the new UI. Maybe later, who knows? Updates should be more consistent from now on.
- The GitHub repository will be cleaned up (issues and pull requests closed) as nothing there are relevant anymore.
- Please use the Feedback feature of Dalamud to report any issues you would meet.
- </:croissant:>

### New from 2.0.0.5
- Fixed DRK's Stalwart Soul not reverting to Unleash when below level 40.
