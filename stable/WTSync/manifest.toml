changelog = """
* Added: Share links. Got a friend who can't or doesn't use plugins? You can now generate a link and they can view WTSync in their browser. For privacy, these links expire after 30 minutes and only show characters' initials.
* Added: Wondrous Tails statistics. What duties are people doing? Are people finishing their Wondrous Tails? How many stickers do people have? Find out now with our new weekly reports.

* Added option to opt out from statistics. The data is fully anonymous, but I understand some people aren't cool with that sort of thing so, for those of you who aren't, just opt out and you won't be included.
* Added links to the WTSync website to its settings window.
