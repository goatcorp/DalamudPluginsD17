changelog = """
Updated for FFXIV 7.3 and Dalamud API 13.

* Added: Share Nickname setting, which lets you set a name for yourself that shows up if someone shares the party's WTSync status.
* Changed: Only respond to left-clicks when clicking on a Wondrous Tails duty to prevent conflicts with the new native context menu.
* Changed: Start tracking sticker positions for eventual inclusion into statistics so we can see how many players get 1, 2, or 3 lines.
