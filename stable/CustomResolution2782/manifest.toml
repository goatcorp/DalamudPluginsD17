Since last stable:
- Move internal utilities to new shared utility
- API14 compat, migrate from SharpDX to TerraFX (except compiler)
- Fix Dalamud UI cursor positioning (apparently broken since late API13)
- Implement scaling via new internal mode to work around GPU driver bugs and crashes
- Improve exclusive fullscreen mode support
Since last testing:
- Nothing, but bump version anyway to work around a Dalamud metadata bug.
