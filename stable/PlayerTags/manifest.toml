changelog = """ Version 1.7.5.1
- Rename Plugin to Player Tags for better searchability.

Version 1.7.5
- Chat: Support group number prefix for Custom Tags
- Chat: Make Custom Tags color prio if used for whole name

Version 1.7.4
- Chat: Minor adjustments that sometimes cause weird behavior, like...
    - The own username has been added to the start of the message text and not within
    - The message get colored completely and not only the name
    - Messages by ExtraChat looked weird sometimes

Version 1.7.3
- Chat: Optimize handling with abbreviated names in group and alliance chat

Version 1.7.2
- Chat: Show your own name abbreviated in Chat, if abbreviated is setted up in character config
    --> The game does abbreviate your own character name AFTER Dalamuds chat handler and only if it is unchanged. So PlayerTags need to abbreviate the name itself.

Version 1.7
- Improved handling of own character name in chat
- Improved handling of group/alliance number prefix (always insert tag and icon behind)
- Added new property for Tags to choose if the tag and icon should be inserted before or behind the group/alliance number prefix
- Marked the Chat features as stable
- Removeed option \"Link Self In Chat\"
    - It's now a part of the Chat feature itself
--> This update includes a few bigger internal adjustments. Please let me know if you have any problems after the update!

Version 1.6.6
- Improved self linking in chat feature
    - Improves compatiblity with ChatTwo
    - Technical Stuff: Use PlayerPayload only as index, remove it before going back to the game and keep the TextPayload
