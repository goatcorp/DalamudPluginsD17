* Updated for Dalamud 9.
* You can now explicitly specify 12-hour, 24-hour, or system time format for timestamps.
* New features and bugfixes thanks to GitPaulo:
** Added an option to show Snooper windows on startup unless closed (on by default).
** Added filter bars to the bottom of Snooper windows.
** Added a "joint" hover mode, which prioritizes targeted players over hovered players.
** Disabled mouseover targeting from triggering when the mouse is over the Snooper window.
** Fixed an issue with the percent sign (%) not rendering correctly.
