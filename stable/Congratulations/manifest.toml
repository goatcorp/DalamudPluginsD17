Get aurally rewarded when you get commended on duties.

Comes with default sounds for when you get commended by 1/3, 2/3, 3/3 or all seven members of the duty you were in, but you can set custom sounds for each type of trigger by opening /congratsconfig.

The fractioned values are in relation to how many of those members could commend you (i.e. excluding those that were in your party before joining the duty).
