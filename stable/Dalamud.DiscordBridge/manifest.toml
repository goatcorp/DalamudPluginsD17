New Changes:
- Set fallback sendername value if there is none. This will be `<your character name> <chat type>`

Last Changes:
- Fixed duplicate chat issue.
- Added a classic embed fallback feature in case webhooks fail.
- Fixes for NET7 / API 8
- Updated library dependencies and switched to NetStone as submodule.
- Switched to using full-width ï¼  because Discord started enforcing username requirements on webhooks and @ isn't allowed there.
