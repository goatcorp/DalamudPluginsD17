    + [1.3.0.0]
    + Images, Images everywhere.
    + Will now show Minion and Battle Pet images
    + Will now show profile pictures (when enabled) in the Player Select list in the Pet List screen.
    + [1.2.4.0]
    + Added chaching to multiple search functions improving performance by a lot. (For some functions I've measured 4x the performance :D)
    + Added support for the minion notebook (Note that using the search function will still use work using the base minion name, trust me I'm working on it)
