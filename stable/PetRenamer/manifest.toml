    [2.2.0.4]
    Empty data will get send over IPC a lot less. (This shouldn't happen actually, I just haven't found the underlying issue yet.)
    Made the rename window's minimum width slightly smaller so people won't hamstring themselves into not seeing the input field.
    Added a couple tags so people will find the plugin via very specific search querries easier.
