- Added a By Patch filter option (thanks @Kouzukii for the data I absolutely stole without pity from Which Patch Was That)
- Added right clicking on most options to revert them to their default state
-# Fixed the Try On issue where it didn't apply the second dye when using the up/down arrow keys
-# Fixed the size of the selected item box to make it the same size as unselected to avoid misclicking in the list by @smrq
-# Fixed the size of the job selection area in the Equip as filter to avoid clipping because some sheep complained
