changelog = "- Preset currencies have been reduced from 19 to 3 (Now: Gil, Tomestones with/without weekly capped [exclude Poetic]). So you can delete most of them instead of just hiding now.\n- Optimised the problem that the mouse wheel page flip function was too sensitive\n- Custom Tracker now also supports mouse wheel page flipping."
