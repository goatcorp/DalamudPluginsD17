- Code cleanup.
- Refactored the Add Custom Currency and Multi-Chara Stats interface.
- Refactored the LanguageManager.

- Fixed an issue where a single handler uninstallation error would prevent the entire plugin from being normally disabled.
- Fixed an issue that the automatic backup time was displayed incorrectly when the AutoBackup module was disabled and then enabled again.
- Optimized the Main window open speed.
- Added a new feature: Display Currency Changes in Server Bar, which allows you to show specific currency changes in the DTR bar.
