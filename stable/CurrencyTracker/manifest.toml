changelog = "- Fixed a BUG that displayed the wrong number of merged transaction.\n- Fixed a BUG in the Chat Mode where sometimes Teleport Costs were not recorded promptly.\n- Removed Track Mode button and Timer Mode.\n- Changed the Export .CSV button to Export, and it now supports choosing between .csv and .md formats for export (this format selection will affect the data format obtained from export and copy functions in other places).\n- Modified the logic of plugin operation during PVP, which should result in some performance improvements.\n- Unified the open/use logic for table-related functions to the right-click mouse button.\n- Now, when you right-click on the Location field of a single transaction, it will directly open the editing popup window.\n- Added a Table Appearance button, allowing you to modify the displayed columns of the table (currently, you can choose to show/hide the Order, Location, and Note Columns) and modify the number of Transactions Per Page (the logic for opening Transactions Per Page modification popup window when clicking the current page label remains unchanged).\n- Added a Note field for single transactions.\n- Now, Merged Transactions Count and the Teleport Costs will be automatically recorded in the Note field of the new transaction generated.\n- Now, right-clicking on the Note column header can bring up a search box, with logic consistent with the Location search box (English: case insensitive; Simplified Chinese: supports Pinyin search).\n- Now, right-clicking on the Note field of a single transaction will directly open the editing window.\n- Now, hovering the mouse over the Note field of a single transaction will display the complete content of the note as a tooltip.\n- The Edit options in the table toolbar now also support batch modification of the Note field of selected transactions."
