### Added
- The craft overlay has arrived, this collapsable overlay will show you the next steps in your current craft project.
  - Has a menu for each item for buying/gathering/crafting
  - Is retainer aware, so it'll only show you what you need to extract from each retainer while it's open
  - Provides quick switching between active craft list
- Item icons within the AT interface can now be hovered and a tooltip will show, this can be configured to show never/on icon hover/row hover
- Right clicking on any item within AT will now provide a Gather/Buy/Craft menu with the ability to teleport to specific nodes/shops
- New filter called "Glamour Ready Combined", shows if an item is part of a set that gets combined in the glamour chest
- Extra vendors have been included
- The item window will show if an item has been combined into a glamour ready set
- Initial 7.11 data

### Fixed
- Fishing/Spearfishing items should show more accurate locations
- Certain vendors were not showing due to having no name will now show their NPCs name instead
- Housing vendors have been de-deduplicated
