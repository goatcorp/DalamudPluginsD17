Add an ingredient search filter(this will calculate the ingredients required to craft the items selected in the filters configuration and only show those ingredients)
Filters now have a reset button to quickly clear their settings
Multiple choice filters can now be searched from the setting interface + you can add all the items in the drop down list with a button
Added 6.4 submarine drops and unlocks (thanks Infi <3)
