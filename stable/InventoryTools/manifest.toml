**New Features**

- New craft lists will append a number on the end if a craft list with that name already exists
- Added "Name (Selector)" filter for picking items you want to show in a list as a stop gap until a favourites and/or other system is implemented
**Improvements**
- Minor tweaks to the UI for clarity
