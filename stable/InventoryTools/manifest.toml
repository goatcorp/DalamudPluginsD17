### The Lumina Rewrite
- With support for API11 comes a rewrite of AT's data layer that was required due to lumina changes(how we access the game's sheet data)
- There will definitely be some broken things and changes with how the sources/uses are displayed/used in craft lists so please bear with me
- Sources and uses will generally be more detailed now and hovering over them will provide you with seal costs/rewards/etc
- Memory/load time improvements, I've seen as little as 100MB not factoring in lumina's own caches, I've seen it load in under 2-3 seconds now too
- Any bugs, please jump on the xivlauncher discord or from AT's menu hit File -> Report a issue
