**New Features**
- Craft Completion Mode: Can choose to delete or leave items on completion
- Completed items will show a red X allowing for quickly removing them from a list
- The craft list "To Craft" list can now be shown as tabs or as it currently is(a giant table)

**Fixes**
- Removing a craft item will be more consistent
- Completed items will show as "Completed" instead of "Waiting"
- When collapsing/expanding the "To Craft" and "Items in Retainers/Bags" sections, the table layout should stay consistent
- Output items were not checking against the HQRequireds list(Kiwikahawai)
