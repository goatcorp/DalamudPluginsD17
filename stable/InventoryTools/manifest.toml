### Added
- Changelog window added
- Acquiring items through Gathering/Crafting/Buying/Combat will now count towards craft completion for output items. These can be toggled per craft list in the 'Completion Tracking' section.
  - This uses a new acquisition tracker, please report any issues with it
  - It's possible to switch back to the old craft tracker, check settings, the old one only tracks crafts
- Sources/Uses added for quests
- The Acquisition/Use columns now have column filters allowing you to search for specific types, categories, rewards and requirements for items
- Overhaul to right click menus on sources/uses.

### Fixed
- When a craft list is grouped by precraft craft type, grouping will attempt to adjust itself if 2 precrafts rely on each other and an item in the second group is required to be completed before the first.
- When a specific item was set in the ingredient preference list in a craft list, it was not being used over the default logic
- Fixed rare crash in universalis
- Fixed a bug that'd cause all items to be considered inside a gearset.
- Glamour chest parsing should be reliable and not lose track of items
- Added more safety around when free company credits are scanned
- Fixes to the way text is vertically aligned within table cells
- Ingredient counts in the "Required" column will show the correct total
- Squashed some imgui asserts
- If there are no known locations of mobs, it'll display that instead of displaying nothing in the item window
- Creating a new list will actually open the configuration window to the list correctly
- Universalis requests will now contain a user agent matching the plugin's internal name and version
