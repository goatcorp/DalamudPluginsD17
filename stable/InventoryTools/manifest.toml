### Added

- The craft window will warn you when a Universalis request failed, listing the date it happened, and to inform the user of a back off period. It will also warn the user if they make too many requests in a given time period(due to too many plugins making requests).

### Fixed

- Changing the "Retainer Retrieval" setting via the Retainer Bell icon in the craft settings column will refresh the craft list properly.
- Fixed caching of the "Columns" tab that meant that some available columns would not show up.
- The windows tab in the main configuration window had somehow been lost in the shuffle, it's back where it should be.
- Some of the vendors were not parsing due to a bug in LuminaSupplemental, those vendors should now show again.
