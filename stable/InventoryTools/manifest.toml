### Fixed
- Fixed an issue in craft lists where multiple items requiring the same item would want more than was actually needed. This only occurred on sub-items that had a Yield above 1.
- The off-hand item can now be unselected in the equipment suggestion window
- The context menu integration has been fixed when right clicking on an item in the hand-in npc in the firmament

### Added
- The equipment suggestion category drop down now has extra options for combat, Melee/Tank/Ranged/Caster
- A loading icon was added to the equipment suggestion window when results are being calculated.

### Changed
- The HQ stats in item tooltips are now absolute
- Large inventory files should load faster
- The equipment suggestion system will now suggest items outside the range shown if no items are available. An icon will be displayed indicating if this is the case.
