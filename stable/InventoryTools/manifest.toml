### Fixed
- Duties are now stored based off their ID and not the map of the duty as some maps may host more than 1 duty.
- Fixed a bug that'd cause the craft system to think more crafts were capable then actually were
- Fixed a bug where the wrong slot was being accessed in glamour chests
- Fixed a bug when moving the position of a list would not reflect correctly in the UI
- Switched the majority of ImGui Begin/End's to ImRaii, @ me if you notice anything amiss in the UI

### Added
- Empty is now an ingredient sourcing options for all items allowing you to source the item in whatever way you wish
