## Added
 - Configuration window reorganised with more sub-sections
 - Source/Use grouping is now configurable
 - Each tooltip modification can now have it's own colour set(or will fallback to the default colour)
 - Source/use tooltip added, will show you the sources/uses for an item inside the tooltip, fully configurable allowing for sources/uses to be hidden/grouped/ungrouped/reordered
 - The `Add Item Locations` tooltip can now be sorted by Item quantity

## Fixed
