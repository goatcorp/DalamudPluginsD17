### Added
- Added a yes/no filter for every single source/use
- Added a yes/no filter for every single source/use category
- Added a item unlock tooltip(shows which characters have an item unlocked)
- Added a search for the list configuration(hopefully this helps configuring lists easier)

- Added exterior house items and housing fixtures as uses

### Changed

- The way filters are displayed in the list configuration has been adjusted
- Certain filters were superceeded by the source/use system, any lists using those have been migrated
- Amount Owned was renamed to Item Locations

### Fixed
- Item searching in a few places was inconsistent
- Certain tabs of the list configuration page were causing massive FPS drops
- The sample lists did not have any columns by default
