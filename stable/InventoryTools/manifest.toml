### Added

- Added a new "Seach" context menu, provides similar functionality to the game's search but will search across whatever scope you define
- Bicolour Gem Vendors will now show NPCs and their respective locations
- Added new mob spawn data (thanks to Emma <3)

### Fixed

- The context menu shortcuts will now work correctly in the market board
- When using "Active Character" in any of the inventory scopes, this will now consider any "characters" owned by your logged in character as also active
- Removed some old incorrect mob spawn data
