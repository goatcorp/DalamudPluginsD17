changelog = "Barring anything major probably the last release for a few weeks at least, back to EW main story, hopefully this get's the majority of people sorted :)\n- Bug Fixes\n- Stopped a potential memory leak\n- Removed old commands from showing in help\n- The hotkey check I had in place could have been causing lag, have tweaked it.\n- Improved draw times of each window\n- People with higher font sizes and ui scales should hopefully be able to see all the buttons\n- Collapsing either of the craft window sections will have the other section take the available space.\n- The inventory scanning process now runs in the thread pool, hopefully this should reduce stuttering when any item movement occurs(and a rescan needs to happen)."
