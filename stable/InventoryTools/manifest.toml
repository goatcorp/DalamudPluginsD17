### Changed
- Added data for 7.31
- This stable release includes the major changes introduced for the source/destination system, please see the change log accessible inside the File menu within any of the plugin's windows

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that would cause a craft list to not highlight in certain cases
- The way interior housing sources are calculated was reworked so items not visible in the in-game housing catalog are shown
- The highlighting colors configurable in each list will now show a override button instead of the previous unintuitive behaviour
- The highlight when setting inside a list's configuration will now list "Use Global Configuration" if the list is using the highlighting mode setting in the main configuration
