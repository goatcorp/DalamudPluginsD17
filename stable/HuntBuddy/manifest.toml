changelog = "- Added a new sub command argument `local` to toggle the display of the local map zone's hunt targets window, instead of needing to open the main window, open the configuration, toggle the box, and close the configuration.\n- Added the ability to lock window size/position to prevent accidentally moving the windows while attempting to click on the controls.\n- The main window's tree display of hunt marks per zone no longer indents the line with the mob name and utility buttons.\n- Condensed the two buttons to locate the mobs on the map into one that performs a configurable default of either marker-and-area or marker-only, and performs the alternate action when `shift` is held while clicking.\n- Added another new sub command `next` to place a marker on the next hunt mark location. If there are any in the current zone, the nearest (two-dimensional euclidean distance) will be selected. Otherwise, if there are any hunts in the current expansion's other zones, one of them will be selected at random. Finally, all hunts anywhere in the world will be considered, and one of them will be selected at random. If other zones had to be examined for hunt marks, the main map will be opened to the appropriate zone.\n- Updated local hunt buttons to match main window ones.\n- Added chat message to `/phb next` command, so you know what you're looking for.\n- Updated the Teleporter IPC consumer check to better handle installing/uninstalling Teleporter without reloading HuntBuddy.\n\nMassive thanks to PrincessRTFM for these changes!"
