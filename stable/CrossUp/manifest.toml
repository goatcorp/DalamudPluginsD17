changelog = """
With the plugin appearing to have survived Patch 6.4 very comfortably, I'm ready to push the latest build to Stable. Hooray!

For the non-testing world, here's a recap! CrossUp is a plugin for controller users, providing more options to customize how the game's Cross Hotbar looks and feels to use.
- Various visual customizations, including colour schemes and layout modifications
- Allows the Expanded Hold Controls (accessed with L→R and R→L inputs) to be displayed as separate elements onscreen, rather than sharing space with the main bar
- Enables extra bars to automatically switch sets alongside the main bar
