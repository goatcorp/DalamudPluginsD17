changelog = """
- If a hidden hotbar is switched to visible through use of CrossUp features, the plugin will no longer try to re-hide it later (it seems CrossUp was sometimes being a little too aggressive and hiding bars it shouldn't).
- Under the hood stuff: made further adjustments to prevent errors on disposal/exit, and partially implemented IAddonLifeCycle
