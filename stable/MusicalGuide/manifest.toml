Musical Guide is a camera enhancement plugin,
providing a customizable real first person view with your character visible,
as well as limited automation of 3rd person camera distances to help avoid
having to zoom in and out yourself when changing activities.

Changes since testing:
- Added a warning, when 1st person camera auto-adjustment is enabled
