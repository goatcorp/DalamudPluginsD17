changelog = """
- Switched pet matching to use ContentId, thus eliminating false-positive matches
- Added support for custom sizes of MCH, SCH, DRK, and fixed-size SMN pets
- Pet custom size will not be set in PvP
- Added the ability to add a new entry by typing the character name in the Character filter box
- Fixed bug where fairy setting would always set a size
- Pets will revert to their vanilla size when an entry is removed and on plugin unload, if they're still around
- Slowed down the plugin by only 3.5 times instead of 4.5 times
