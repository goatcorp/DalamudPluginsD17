Initial stable release!

Who's Talking connects to your Discord client and lets you see voice activity on your party list. It should automatically match up Discord users with FFXIV players – but if that doesn't work, you can configure things in the plugin settings.

DelvUI integration is included, so Who's Talking should automatically work with DelvUI (appearance options are available in the DelvUI settings).

**Please ping @sersorrel when asking questions or reporting bugs** – I have #plugins-general muted and will not see your message otherwise.
