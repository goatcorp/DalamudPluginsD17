**Why are you teleporting away from me, my friend? You are _dead_ to me.**
- Now, one of the voice lines (whose section starts with an L) will only play if you are inside a duty. \
This prevents it from being played if you are in a party and everyone else teleports away. (Thanks HuiEtyud for the report!)
