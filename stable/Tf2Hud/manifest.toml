[REQUIRES TF2 INSTALLED FOR MOST FEATURES]
The Mann Brothers just found a deposit of gravel in Eorzea
and hired YOU, Mercenary of Light, to help them FIGHT for it.

* Show a Win Panel (with sounds!) when you clear or get wiped in a duty.
* Show a TF2-style timer while in a duty.
* Enable the "Voice Lines" module (via /tfconfig) to have voice lines play when certain conditions are met. What conditions, you ask? It's a surprise! (Unless you uncheck the "Surprise me!" box.)
* More features maybe soon?

Note: This plugin uses files from a local Team Fortress 2 installation.
It'll search for the game's installation folder in all configured Steam Library Folders automatically.

Without a TF2 install, the Timer and Win Panel will work with FF XIV fonts, and no voice line will work.
