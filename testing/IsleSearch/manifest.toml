**IsleSearch (initial release)**
- Comes from the wonderful suggestion by Gidedin (https://discord.com/channels/581875019861328007/685275026156683280/1136621420487647332)
- Adds a search field to the top of the Set Agenda window in Island Sanctuary.
- Multiple matches possible, try `Grow|Clam|Butter` as an example (commas also work).
- Categories will highlight as well, and your search will persist as you set your schedule.
- More features coming soon.
