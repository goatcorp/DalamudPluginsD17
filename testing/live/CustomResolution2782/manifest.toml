changelog = """
- Fix gameplay scaling with iGPUs (blurry wasn't always blurry)
- Add a blinking button for those who are stuck on DLSS in the in-game settings despite the dropdown being greyed out.
- ... and fix the HUD vanishing when the game configuration is in such an invalid state.
- Rebrand hang protection as lag protection, and give it 4 more frames to consider.
