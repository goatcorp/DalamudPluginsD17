changelog = """
If universalis has trouble, the problem is now displayed to the user rather than just defaulting mysteriously to shop prices.
It will now auto swap jobs when clicking the recipe icon to view in the recipe log.
Plugin icon also updated (screenshot of an aetheryte is far too generic)
