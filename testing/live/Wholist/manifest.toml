changelog = """
- Add inbound 'Integrations' support (IPC) that allows other plugins to add their own context menu items to players on the 'Nearby Players' list
	* These integrations will come from other plugins, so if you experience issues using them please reach out to their developer instead.
    
- Performance when setting the "Max players to show" configuration option lower than the current nearby players list has been drastically improved.
- Items that were previously unable to be translated now support localization
- Various code cleanup changes.
