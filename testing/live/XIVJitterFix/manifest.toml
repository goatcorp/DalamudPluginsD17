- Add toggle to 'Override Downscaling Settings' that defaults to off
  - this potentially fixes an issue where beta version of DLSSTweaks might not always apply DLSS and always fall back to DLAA
  - If the toggle is not switched on, the plugin will not attempt to set 'Ignore Downscaling' to the engine to any value
  - If you used the 'Ignore Downscaling' toggle for DLAA usage prior, the 'Override Downscaling Settings' toggle will be enabled instead of disabledthat by default
