changelog = """
**First testing release** 
- this plugin aims to fix the anti aliasing implementation of SquareEnix
The game automatically disables the needed jitter for temporal antliasing during cutscenes, NPC dialogue and gpose.
This plugin forcefully reenables this functionality, leading to a cleaner image.
Additionally includes configuration for:
- jitter factor multiplier
- ignore downscaling for buffers (essential if you are running DLAA)
