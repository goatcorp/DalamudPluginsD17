changelog = """Updated the configuration window to be (hopefully) more intuitive.

- You can now pick a random title from the current group in the configuration window, without using commands.
- 'Save' is now an actual save, changes made in the configuration won't have any effect on using /ptitle until saved.
- Added 'Save and Close'/'Save and Go Back'/'Discard Changes' as distinct buttons."""
