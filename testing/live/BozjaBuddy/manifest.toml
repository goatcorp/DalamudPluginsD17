changelog = """
+ Added temporary support for alarms to trigger on Critical Engagements (CE). This requires the Resistance Recruitment in-game window to open. This is a half-ass attempt at implementing the feature, due to technical issues at the moment. Will (hopefully) be improved later on.
+ Added the option to set Alarm to trigger upon any CE.
+ Added a maplink button to each Fate/CE alarm in Alarm in-game window.
+ Added a UI Hint to remind user to keep the Resistance Recruitment in-game window open for CE-related features. Only display when any of said features are actively being used (e.g. having CE alarm, looking at Fate/CE table)
+ Added a config option to turn off the above UI hint in Config window. (Config > UI Hints > [A] > [1])
------ Bug fixes
+ Fix a bug where alarm related-features would break upon deleting an alarm in Expired Alarms section"""
