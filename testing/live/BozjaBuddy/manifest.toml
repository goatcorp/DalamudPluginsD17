Bozja Buddy 0.3.0.3

- Added option for Fate/CE alarms to be set to all FATEs, all CEs, all FATE/CEs, and can be filtered by zone (e.g. Zadnor zone 3). These options exclude CLL, Dalriada, Delubrum Reginae Normal & Savage.

- Fixed a bug in Custom loadout tab where the whole tab would be unavailable upon using any Custom loadout Filter related features.
- Fixed a bug in Custom loadout tab where disabling rec. loadouts would also hide user's loadouts.
- Fixed a bug (hopefully) in Custom loadout tab where the Import from Clipboard button would not work properly.
