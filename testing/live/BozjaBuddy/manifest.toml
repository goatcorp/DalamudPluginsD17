Bozja Buddy 0.3.2.1
- Added Character Stats window:
+ Character stats (require character to at least be in Bozja/Zadnor/Delubrum content once)
+ User's Lost find Cache, with alert for actions that are running low.
- Added configs for the abovementioned alert.
- Added a button in upper top General bar to open the Character Stats window.
- Added a number next to Lost action links, showing the amount of Lost action in player's possession.

- Revision of many tooltip texts.
- Fix an issue where the game will crash under the following condition: Open Config > UI Assist > [A] and let the drop down open for 30s or more.
- Fix an issue where the button in Active Loadout bar in main window would not sync with the one on top of in-game Lost Find Cache window.
