Bozja Buddy 0.3.4.4
- Added a Lost Find Cache filter option [7] to allow auto role-filter based on player's current role.
- Added a helper button on the top bar of the main window. Hovering shows keybinds, clicking shows a helper popup.

- Fix a bug where the text filter for Lost Find Cache does not work as intended when user does not have an Active Loadout.
