**[Testing] Allagan Tools 1.13.1.0**

### List Source/Destination Changes
- The way that sources and destinations work has changed, the individual dropdowns have been removed and replaced with a new scope picker.
- From the scope picker you can define a set of inventories, characters, categories or worlds you want to match against.
- Craft lists have received the same upgrade and also include a "Staging Area" scope that lets you pick which items are considered to be in your inventory
- Your previous settings will be migrated

The other following additions were made:

### Added
- Preconfigured/sample lists were added to the lists menu in the lists window
- A import/export menu item was added to the lists menu

Please hit up the Allagan Tools #plugin-help-forum topic on the XIVLauncher/Dalamud discord if you run into any issues!
