**Allagan Tools: v1.6.0.4**
- Have finished crafts count correctly towards completion based on their flags
- Add the ability to choose "Empty" as a source
- Fix an issue where setting an item to 0 while Hide Completed is active would remove all the items
- The craft table now has a moveable splitter with a saved position + the original collapse functionality
- Copying a configuration into the default craft list now works
- Stopped items that can't be bought from gil vendors from being considered as buyable(even if they have a buy from vendor price)
- Unless there are other bugs this will be the final release before this is pushed to live
