changelog = """\
**Allagan Tools: v1.6.0.3**
Added in craft list zone system(you can specify preferred zones and also override the zone on each item)
The HQ Required, Retrieve from Retainer and Source Preferences can be switched by left clicking/right clicking their icons
Group headers in craft lists can have their text colour changed
Tooltip category whitelist/blacklist added
Ignore escape key setting added for most windows
Added missing vendors
Ventures and Exploration ventures were split as exploration ventures are random and might not be preferred
Items from housing vendors are not duplicated and will indicate they are available only from placable vendors
Active Craft List functionality added(when a craft list is active, crafts count towards it) + auto switch craft list setting added. IPC calls added for activating/deactivating craft lists
Duplicate "Open in Crafting Log" fixed
Fixed an issue where zeroing an item in a craft list would zero all items
Fixes in the way tooltips are displayed when HQ items are involved
If a craft generates extra materials due to yield, we'll try to take less from external sources
Had a lot of help from KiwiKahawai testing and on the dev side, big thanks to them :)
