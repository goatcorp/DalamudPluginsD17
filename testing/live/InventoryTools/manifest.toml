**Allagan Tools 1.7.0.2**
- Thanks for all the bug reports, as this is a rework they are to be expected, hopefully I've gotten the most obvious ones

**Fixes:**
- Craft lists would ignore items in your inventory sometimes
- Crafting items would not reduce the number in the craft list even if it was active
- The sample filters added by the wizard now have the correct settings
- All numeric filters now have a tooltip explaining the operators that can be used
- Adding a new list from the item lists window will actually open the configuration window and edit the list properly
- Removed the history notification as the configuration wizard takes care of it
- Fixed an issue with filters showing filters in a category as having been modified when they weren't
- Fixed a race issue on dispose of the plugin
- Stopped certain fields from being serialized in the config
