changelog = "- Another performance related release\n- Improved draw times of each windows\n- People with higher font sizes and ui scales should hopefully be able to see all the buttons\n- Collapsing either of the craft window sections will have the other section take the available space.\n- The inventory scanning process now runs in the thread pool, hopefully this should reduce stuttering when any item movement occurs(and a rescan needs to happen)."
version = "1.2.0.4"
