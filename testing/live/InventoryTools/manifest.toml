**Allagan Tools 1.7.0.0 - Reworked**
- With this version comes an entirely reworked internal structure, which should give a much more reliable base for any new features I decide to add. To go along with the new internals are:

**New Features:**
- All columns can now be renamed and some can be configured, multiple copies of the same column can be added
- The market integration now supports multiple worlds, associated columns and craft lists can be configured to pick which worlds are applicable to you
- The more information window has a market tab listing the current prices
- Configuration wizard for when you first install the plugin and if you choose when new features come out
- Buy/craft/gather button columns added
- Favourites column added
- Add to craft list context menu added
- The plugin can be opened when not logged in
- A icon can be added to the main dalamud menu for easy access


**Changes:**
- Filters are now called Lists so there are Item Lists and Craft Lists
- Settings menus reworked
- Support .net 8(finally)

**Removed:**
- Some of the older Inventory Tools specific slash commands
