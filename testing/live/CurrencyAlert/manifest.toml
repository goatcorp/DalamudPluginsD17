=== 0.5.0.0
Version provided by MidoriKami
- Configuration remade and much more clean now
- More configuration options (such as minimal display, window lock, etc)
- Dynamic currency display, so further game updates shouldn't need a plugin update
- Base code for translations (soon...)
=== 0.4.0.0
- Added new Tomestones of Causality
- Added icons for currencies
- Added an option to lock the alert window
- Revamped the configuration UI a bit
- Revamped the user configurations code internally, which unfortunately resulted in an inevitable configuration reset
