changelog = """# Wordsmith v1.8.1 Patch Notes

## New Features:
  * When adding a word to the custom dictionary it should now automatically remove all detected spelling errors with that word in all scratch pads.
  * Roman numerals (capital letters only) will no longer be detected as a spelling error.
  * Alias `+` button now disabled by default until valid information entered.

## UI Changes:
  * `Custom Dictionary Entries` is now written in a table header not a text object.

## Bugs Fixed:
  [FIXED] Incorrect spelling error detections and word alignment.
  [FIXED] Contractions are counted as a spelling error.
  [FIXED] Unable to add words to custom dictionary
  [FIXED] Scratch Pad doesn't always split on sentence.
  [FIXED] Deleting a search item from the thesaurus could cause an error to occur.
  [FIXED] Chunks sometimes formed at strange locations.
  [FIXED] Selecting `Copy Text To Clipboard` for a history item would cause a CTD.
  [FIXED] Spelling suggestions giving garbage results at times.

## Technical Stuff:
  * Incorrect spelling error detection caused by not unwrapping string before running spellcheck. The solution was to unwrap the string.
  * Contractions were counted as spelling errors because the text was used in spellchecking not the Regex match value.
  * Adding words to dictionary was not unwrapping the string first leading to unwanted behaviors.
  * Found an issue with calculating where to split the chunks that could lead to not breaking on a sentence terminator when one is available and managed to fix it.
  * Found an issue where deleting a thesaurus item could cause an error dump due to a modified collection exception.
  * Found an infinite loop in `Copy Text To Clipboard`."""
