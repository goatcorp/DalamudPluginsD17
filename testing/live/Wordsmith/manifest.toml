changelog = """# Wordsmith v1.7.7 Patch Notes

## New Features:
* Using Ctrl+C in the text input of a ScratchPad will now copy the unwrapped text. (This will not include headers)

## UI Changes:
* Open Scratch Pads in the ScratchPads tab of the Settings UI now has a minimum size. (See bug fixes 1)
* Added a `Show Advanced Settings` option to the settings page to hide and show the more advanced settings of the plugin.
* The `Bug?` button in Settings will now show a message box that gives the user an idea of what kind information to include in a bug report.
* The `Bug?` button in Settings has been renamed to `Found A Bug?`
* Added a tooltip to the `Buy Me A Ko-Fi` button that explains the nature of the button.
* Redesigned the `Replace Text Suggestions` list

## Bugs Fixed:
1. The height of the `Open Scratch Pads` section in the ScratchPads tab of the Settings UI could become 0 if there was no room left in the window.
2. Major performance loss with large text entries.
3. Right clicking on the `Replace Text` input field would cause word wrapping to temporarily break.

## Technical Stuff:
* PadState class has been moved to the DataTypes.cs file
* Added more error reporting in an attempt to catch a bug that was reported.
* Adjusted the way UI is drawn in the ScratchPad (Switching away from tables. No visual difference should be noticeable)
* Removed some unnecessary `if` statements from the saving settings process.
* There was a minor calculation issue in the way text was displayed that was causing a massive drop in performance. By changing the way the calculation is handled I was able to bring massive performance gains to Wordsmith. I sincerely apologize to everyone for any performance issues they may have experienced with Wordsmith until this point."""
