changelog = """# Wordsmith v1.8.0 Patch Notes

## New Features:
 * Added another placeholder for marker text `#r` is replaced with the number of remaining chunks.
 * Added an entire new marker system that allows the user to insert marks with several customization options.

## UI Changes:
 * Added a `Marks & Tags` Category to scratch pad settings.
 * Moved `OOC` Options to `Marks & Tags` category.
 * Added an option to enable `OOC` by default to `Marks & Tags`.
 * Added a marks list to `Marks & Tags` category.
 * Added a `New Marker` section to `Marks & Tags` category list.
 * Changed the tooltip for `OOC` toggle in Scratch Pads to say `OOC markers` instead of `OOC double parenthesis`
 * Scratch Pad maximum size increased to `float.MaxValue`

## Bugs:
 [FIXED] `Punctuation Cleaning List` in advanced spell check settings does not reset.
 [FIXED] `Punctuation Cleaning List` not saving with settings.
 [FIXED] Chunk data not updating when settings saved.
 [FIXED] The text input box could scroll to the right on accident with no way to scroll back.
 [FIXED] Error window could fail if an IntPtr was included in the dump data.

## Technical Stuff:
 * Sealed `PadState` class
 * Added `ChunkMarker` class to `DataType.cs`
 * `TextChunk.CompleteText` removed. This has been refactored as a new method `CreateCompleteText(TextChunk)` in `ScratchPadUI.cs`
 * Added more error dumping to all UI forms.
 * `ScratchPadUI.DrawChunkDisplay()` now factors in `ChunkMarker`'s
 * `ScratchPadUI.DrawChunkItem()` Completely refactored to include `ChunkMarker`'s in the correct places
 * `ScratchPadUI.DrawHistoryItem()` Now grabs `ChunkMarker`'s from settings.
 * `ChatHelper.FFXIVify()` Now factors in all markers.
 * Added more debug commands.
 * Added a `ReplacePlaceholders()` extension method for strings to `Extensions.cs` to ensure predictable behavior.
 * Moved global usings to `Wordsmith.cs`
 * Moved global fields to `Wordsmith.cs`
 * Moved `Global.BUTTON_Y_SCALED` to extension method as int.Scale()
 * Changed the way that settings were reset from a custom reset function to simply replacing the Configuration object with `new()` and saving.
 * Removed several unused members from `ScratchPadUI.cs`
 * Reorganized `ScratchPadUI.cs` members into more logical code regions.
 * Removed `ScratchPadUI.cs` alert system in favor of error window system. Spelling errors are now the only error shown.
 * Added a wrapper method `ImGuiExt.SetHoveredTooltip(string)` for `ImGui.SetTooltip(string)` that bundles the `if (ImGui.IsItemHovered())` check
 * Removed unused packages.
 * Spell checking is no-longer done on its own thread.
 * Added another console command to edit spell check settings.
 * Commented many lines of code that didn't have it and summarized many properties, methods, and functions.
