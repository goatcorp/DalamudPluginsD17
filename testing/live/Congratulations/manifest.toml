* Fixes it congratulating you when TPing to Limsa after installing (who should be congratulated on THAT?)
** (Actually, fixes it congratulating you when changing location after first install)
* New option to apply the game's Sound Effects volume to the sounds.
** This is enabled by default.
** For users of v1.0.0.0, the default sounds will be too low on v1.1.0.0. Please do like your healers and adjust the volumes. Thanks!
