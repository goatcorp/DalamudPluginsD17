changelog = """\
		## Adoption of XIVCombo
		- A new UI, more modern and more fitting for the increasing amount of jobs has been added to XIVCombo.
		- Currently, all 65 existing combos have been kept while keeping feature parity as much as possible.
		- Your previous settings will not carry over this new version. A welcoming pop-up will warn you about it.
		- No new features, except the new UI. Maybe later, who knows? Updates should be more consistent from now on.
		- The GitHub repository will be cleaned up (issues and pull requests closed) as nothing there are relevant anymore.
		- Please use the Feedback feature of Dalamud to report any issues you would meet.
