changelog = """\
**New Features**
- The retainer list and retainer sale list can now be highlighted, there is a toggle on the overlay and in the settings making it easier to see at a glance which items have stale pricing or are undercut.
- Added a icon column for the sales/sold lists

**Fixes**
- Numeric columns will now sort properly
- Retainers without classes will show a more appropriate icon
- The recommended price should factor in the undercut amount
- The sale/sold menus in both grid/list views should now be identical

Barring any major bugs, this is the last release before this gets moved out of testing.
