    [2.0.0.5]
    A complete rewrite of Pet Nicknames.
    (Plus a couple sub versions due to ........ c: reasons c: )

    Of Note:
    - All your old names will transfer over!
    - If you have shared your names with someone in the 1.x.x.x version, their names will transfer over. (This will only happen upon meeting them in game once).
    - It's highly accurate and will only rename just the parts you want, this should work accross all client languages unlike before where that casued issues.
    - It's infinitely faster. If you have a big list of shared people you WILL notice an improvement.
    - UI is also completely redone using una.drawing and is now faster and looks (in my opinion) better ... please test it thoroughly as this is a MASSIVE point of contention!
    - Pet Nicknames stays available for any other plogon that uses its data (Except Wotsit for now).
    
    Notable bugs that have been fixed by this update:
    - Anything to do with /petmirage, that system was broken to the core if left unsupervised.
    - Names displaying in places you don't want them to.
    - Names in emotes not displaying properly for German Clients.
    - Imports could stack.

    Notable Removals (Due to their abysmally low usage rate):
    - Reordering of pets in the list (This might return at some point).
    - Export selection. (You either export everything or nothing at all as this goes against the spirit of sharing).
    - Flyout text (This will return).
    - Wotsit search (This might return, NO ONE used it).
    - Minion and Battle Pet specific settings. (Sorry to those that liked it, but it made doing anything with the plogon just... harder).
