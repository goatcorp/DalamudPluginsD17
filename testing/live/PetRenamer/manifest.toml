+ [0.4.2.4]
+ Fixed target of target not working on minions.
(If this version doesn't have any issues for a week, I will push this to Stable :D)
+ [0.4.2.3]
+ BIG FAT SORRY TO EVERYONE!
+ Fixed a bug where healthbars wouldnt update properly anymore.
+ Fixed a bug where 2 pets of the same type with each their own custom nickname would take over each others nicknames.
+ Completely removed the pointer based system.
+ Due to a flicker issue I had to disable pet names in the party list. Do you still want to see/test it use /petconfig,/minionconfig to enable this setting. [DO NOT REPORT THE FLICKERING!]
+ [0.4.2.2]
+ Added more hooks! Your pet name will now also show in your party list, target bar, focus target bar and target of target bar.
+ This implementation is VERY shotty and thus I will push a proper rewrite sometimes soon.
