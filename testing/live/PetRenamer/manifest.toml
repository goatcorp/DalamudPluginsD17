+ Rewrote the naming process to be WAY more stable. Seeing others people's names should work better now.
If not. Please relog. After a relog names should always update.
+ If you get the name '[Error] Contact Glyceri' please do contact me. This means I have overlooked a pet that you can rename and I would like to add it :D
+ Fixed some oopsies so the /petlist window doesnt spawn open, and non summoner and Scholar pets wont be named [Error] Contact: Glyceri anymore.
