    + [1.2.4.0]
    + Added chaching to multiple search functions improving performance by a lot. (For some functions I've measured 4x the performance :D)
    + Added support for the minion notebook (Note that using the search function will still use work using the base minion name, trust me I'm working on it)
    [If you gamers don't find any issues with this version, I'm pushing it to Stable]
