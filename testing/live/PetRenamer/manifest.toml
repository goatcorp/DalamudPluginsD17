	changelog = """
+ [0.4.2.0]
+ New hook based system, and fixed Chocobo bug. Should overall feel smoother.
+ [0.4.1.0]
+ Added Ipc endpoints. You won't even notice it, but this plugin can do great stuffs soon.
+ New save file system. The old system caused giant save file sizes (giant I don't really mean giant, but this is definitely HEAPS smaller)
+ Don't worry, your old nicknames will convert to the new system (I hope)
+ Rewrote old Utils code to definitely be faster and finally be singleton based.
+ [0.4.0.2]
+ Added support for: Esteem and Automaton Queen
+ [0.4.0.1]
+ Added support for renaming your Carbuncle and Faerie.
+ Added a new theme to indicate that you are now renaming a Battle Pet compared to a Minion.
+ Rewrote the naming process to be WAY more stable. Seeing others people's names should work better now.
+ If not. Please relog. After a relog names should always update.
