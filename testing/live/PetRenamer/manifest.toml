changelog = """
+ Added support for renaming your Carbuncle and Faerie.
+ Added a new theme to indicate that you are now renaming a Battle Pet compared to a Minion.
+ Rewrote the naming process to be WAY more stable. Seeing others people's names should work better now.
If not. Please relog. After a relog names should always update.
+ If you get the name '[Error] Contact Glyceri' please do contact me. This means I have overlooked a pet that you can rename and I would like to add it :D
