changelog = """
+ Added the /minion list command. This will show you an overview of all the minions you have nicknamed with quick access to adding, removing and/or renaming them.
+ Save system has been updated to a new format, saving nicknames to a user instead of nicknames as a whole (this will be used later). Don't worry, your old nicknames won't get lost. There is a legacy system in place that will convert your old save file to the new save file system.
+ Renamed the final instance of pet to minion (except for the plugin title, I will keep it like that).
