    + [1.4.2.1]
    + Fixed a bug where Legacy Compatibily would only trigger once.
    + [1.4.2.0]
    + Every different Battle Pet model can now be assigned a name. No more naming per Job.
    + You can no longer see names on models that are Human. Sorry to those that enjoyed this feature, but it is problematic :(
    + Save File Version Updated from Version 7 to Version 8.
