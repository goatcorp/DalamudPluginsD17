+ [0.4.2.2]
+ Added more hooks! Your pet name will now also show in your party list, target bar, focus target bar and target of target bar.
+ This implementation is VERY shotty and thus I will push a proper rewrite sometimes soon.
+ [0.4.2.1]
+ Fixed an issue where the /petname command didn't properly detect you had the Esteem and Automaton Queen pets out.
+ You can always rename them using /petlist,/minionlist,/petnames or /minionnames.
+ [0.4.2.0]
+ New hook based system, and fixed Chocobo bug. Should overall feel smoother.
