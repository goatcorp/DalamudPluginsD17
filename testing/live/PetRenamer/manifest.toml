changelog = """
+ Fixed log spam... sorry
+ Names with all kinds of symbols are now allowed!
+ UI Style changes! The UI should look a lot more appealing now. You can toggle it off in /minionconfig
+ Support for importing and exporting minion name lists. (=) means the minion has stayed the same. (+) means the minion is added newly. (O) means the minions name will be overwritten. 
+ Not yet shown is when a minion gets deleted. Sorry, this will be shown in a future update.
+ If you import a preset from another player (Yes, this should also work perfectly fine) their minion nicknames will now show in game. 
+ This system is not yet compatible with /minionname or /minionlist.
+ [Please let me know of any issues with the new systems. I am unaware of any current issues, so I would like to know when they pop up.]
