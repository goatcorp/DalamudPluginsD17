    + [1.4.3.0]
    + Added Wotsit support.
    + Your xllog should no longer say my plugin failed to dispose hooks. (It has always properly disposed, but now the error should no longer show up.)
    + Changed IPC endpoints.
    + Fixed a bug where using [ ] in your petnames would cause weirdness... there's probably more weirdness that can appear, sorry for that.
