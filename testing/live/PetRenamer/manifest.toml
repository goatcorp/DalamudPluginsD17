changelog = """
+ Added support for subcommands (AKA: if a command is called /petname you can add multiple extra commands that will call the same code. For example: /minionname)
+ (AFAIK) Renamed all instances of pet to minion.
+ Added a little info spot that informs users to look away or resummon the pet to apply the name changes.
