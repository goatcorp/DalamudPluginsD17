[2.4.1.0]
+ Added an IPC Dampener (this might mean nicknames sync later on many quick sequential namechanges).
+ Added the option to rename pets via command.

Command Format:
/petname [action] [target selector] [nickname] [edge colour] [text colour]

Example commands:
/petname set "Hedgehoglet" "George"
/petname clear "Hedgehoglet"
/petname set minion "George" <100, 100, 100>
/petname set target "George" keep <255, 255, 255>
/petname set 2442 "George" clear keep

Note:
Unused parameters will default to "keep".
