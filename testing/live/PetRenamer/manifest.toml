+ [0.4.2.1]
+ Fixed an issue where the /petname command didn't properly detect you had the Esteem and Automaton Queen pets out.
+ You can always rename them using /petlist,/minionlist,/petnames or /minionnames.
+ [0.4.2.0]
+ New hook based system, and fixed Chocobo bug. Should overall feel smoother.
+ [0.4.1.0]
+ Added Ipc endpoints. You won't even notice it, but this plugin can do great stuffs soon.
+ New save file system. The old system caused giant save file sizes (giant I don't really mean giant, but this is definitely HEAPS smaller)
+ Don't worry, your old nicknames will convert to the new system (I hope)
+ Rewrote old Utils code to definitely be faster and finally be singleton based.
