    + [1.2.3.1]
    + Fixed an issue where some item tooltips would go wild (They might still flicker a weird name. Trust me, im working hard on this)
    + The Action Menu now shows custom pet names.
    + Fixed an issue where Battle Pet Names would not automatically regenerate.
    + [1.2.3.0]
    + Remade the whole config window. You can now chose seperate settings per mode. You may want tooltips for battle pets, but not for minions for example.
    + Added a new Quick Menu button
    + Pet list now has a user list mode. (Click on your name in the top left).
    + Export now has an advanced mode. Hold shift and click the [Export] button. Advanced mode allows you to select which pets you want to export.
    + Empty names will now no longer get exported.
    + The layout of some UI elements have been changed.
    + The colours of some UI elements have been changed.
