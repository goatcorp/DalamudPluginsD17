[REQUIRES TF2 TO BE INSTALLED]
The finest mashup of games in the \"I kill things and do it in fashion\" genre.

* Show a Win Panel (with sounds!) when you clear or get wiped in a duty.
* Show the TF2 Timer when in a duty.
* Enable the \"Voice Lines\" module (via /tfconfig) to have voice lines play when certain conditions are met. What conditions, you ask? It's a surprise! (Unless you uncheck the \"Surprise me!\" box.) 
* More features maybe soon?

Note: This plugin uses files from a local Team Fortress 2 installation.
It'll search for the game's installation folder in all configured Steam Library Folders automatically.
