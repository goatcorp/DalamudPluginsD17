[REQUIRES TF2 TO BE INSTALLED]
The finest mashup of games with troubled development histories.

* Show a Win Panel when you clear or get wiped in a duty
* Show a Duty Timer, TF2-style.
* More features maybe soon?

Note: This plugin uses files from a local Team Fortress 2 installation.
It'll search for the game's installation folder in all configured Steam Library Folders automatically.
