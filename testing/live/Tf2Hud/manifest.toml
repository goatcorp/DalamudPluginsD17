[REQUIRES TF2 TO BE INSTALLED]
The finest mashup of games in the \"I kill things and do it in fashion\" genre.

* Show a Win Panel (with sounds!) when you clear or get wiped in a duty
* Show a Duty Timer, TF2-style.
* More features maybe soon?

Note: This plugin uses files from a local Team Fortress 2 installation.
It'll search for the game's installation folder in all configured Steam Library Folders automatically.
