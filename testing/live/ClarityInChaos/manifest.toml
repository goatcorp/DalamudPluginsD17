Version 1.3.1.0:
 - API 9 Compat.
 - Renamed "Alliance" to "Alliance Raids".
 - "Only In Duty" options for Group Sizes.
  - When enabled, the next smaller group is used when outside of duties.
  - If no groups are eligible, "Saved In-Game Settings" are used.
  - Alliance Raids are always "Only In Duty" (Detection logic relies on this)
 - ⚠️ Major refactor of Configuration, may break existing configurations. If experiencing issues, try "Reset plugin configuration and reload" from the Plugin Installer.
