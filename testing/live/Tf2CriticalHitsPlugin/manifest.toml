* Now, critical heals are defined separately from critical damage.
* Option to use the game's sound effects as hitsounds.
* Options separated by combat job:
  * Option to copy settings from one job to other jobs.
* Test the whole shebang at once by clicking on \"Test configuration\"!
  * This works even if your current job is different from the one you're configuring.

Existing users, when installing this update:
* Critical heals will copy your settings from critical damage
  * If your critical damage text is \"CRITICAL HIT!\", it will be changed to \"CRITICAL HEAL!\" for critical heals.
* Your options will be replicated across all jobs automatically.

If you need any help or have any suggestions, reach me at the help thread on the Dalamud Discord or use the feedback button on the plugin installer.

This version wouldn't be possible without the help of the Dalamud Dev Channel, including MidoriKami, Infi, Ottermandias and many others.
