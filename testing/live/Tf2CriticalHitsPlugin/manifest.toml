changelog = """
- Changed logic that checks if a fly text is for damage or heal.
    - This should fix any conflicts with DamageInfo. If they persist, send feedback through Dalamud or on the Discord.
- Reordered options
    - Now all damage types come first, then all heal types.
- Fixed options about PvP (for Direct Damage) and using the game's sound effect volume not being copied between jobs. (Thanks, Grayve!)
