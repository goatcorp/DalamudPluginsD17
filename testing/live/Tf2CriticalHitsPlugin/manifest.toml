Separation of critical heals from own job and other jobs.

* Unfortunately, if another player shares your job, the \"own job\" config will also play.
* Your <=2.0.0.0 config will be migrated automatically.
**** If your text for critical damage (< 2.0.0.0) or critical heals (2.0.0.0) was the default, \
the text for the \"Other jobs' critical heals\" config will be set to its default (THANK YOUR HEALER!).
