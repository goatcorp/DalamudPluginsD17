changelog = """
After update 3.0.0.0, we received a whispering at dawn from Eos and Selene, complaining that crediting the Scholar for their healing is unjust.

We embraced these complaints and, after discussion with the fey union, decided on adding two more configuration submodules: \"Critical Healing from your own fairy\" (Scholar only) and \"Critical Healing from other players' fairies\". One of the faeries gauged the implementation and gave it their official blessing.

We thank the faeries for illuminating us on this matter.
