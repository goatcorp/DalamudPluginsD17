+ Changed how random names work, now supported in every game mode
+ New option to 'Add Target' for tournament mode

Blackjack Mode:
+ Support for all normal blackjack plays
+ Automatic reward calculation based on standard blackjack rules
+ Simplistic, visual view of cards in play
+ Automatic drawing of cards, or manual player-based roll for cards
+ Current players can be seamlessly moved to subsequent rounds

> Further support for custom rules is planned (For example, the dealer can hit above 16)

Feedback is highly welcome, especially from venue dealers that have more inside into how blackjack is played ingame
