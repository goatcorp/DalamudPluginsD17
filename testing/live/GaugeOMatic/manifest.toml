## GAUGE TWEAKS
- **Restored:** The tweaks to hide job gauges have been restored, as users have pointed out that the vanilla client option doesn't play very nice with the plugin.
- **New Tweak for VPR:** *Ready to Reawaken Cue* will prompt the Serpent Offerings Gauge to light up and play the appropriate SFX after pressing Serpent's Ire, just as it would when reaching 50 gauge.
- **New Tweaks for PCT:** *Reposition Canvases* and *Hide Easels* allow you to rearrange the layout of your three Canvases.

## MISC
- Corrected the Hind/Flank Venom text in VPR's Tweak tab
- Removed defunct timers from the MNK default preset
