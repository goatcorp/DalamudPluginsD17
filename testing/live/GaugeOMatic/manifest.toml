## WIDGETS
- Added an Icon option to bar & timer widgets. You can now display the icon for an action or status effect next to its widget. (Also works dynamically with castbar widgets!)
- Added the missing "Behavior" tab to more widgets. Whoops!

Currently only bar & timer widgets have sound and icon options, but these settings will be added to other widget types in the (hopefully near) future.
