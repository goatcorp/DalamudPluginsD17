## WIDGETS
- Added more robust positioning options to many counter widgets. Various counters now allow you to place stacks individually.
- Improved feature parity between bar widgets. The "Hide Full/Empty" options have been added to various bars that previously didn't include them.

## ACTION TRACKERS
- Updated a large amount of action trackers to better reflect the action's highlight state
- Corrected an issue with auto-populating action data, which prevented actions for certain jobs from being selectable (particularly SMN, SCH, and WHM)
- Added a condition to actions that have an MP cost. These actions will now activate a State widget if the player has enough MP to cast the action. This condition *should* account for actions whose MP costs can change (such as BLM and DRK spells)
- Sprint has finally been added for all jobs
