- Added support for lighting presets!
 - Found under the new Lighting tab.
 - Highly experimental feature. Do report any bugs you encounter.
 - Happy GPosing!
- Renamed plugin to match its new, expanded scope
 - Formerly known as 'Camera Loader'
 - Previously saved presets will (should) not be lost.
