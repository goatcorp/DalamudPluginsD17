changelog = """
**Lights, Camera, Action! v0.2.1.0:**
- Added a new preset mode - Camera Orientation
 - Save and load lighting setting relative to the camera instead of the player.
 - Renamed the other modes to match how they actually work. (Whether this will cause more or less confusion remains to be seen)
- Added config setting to adjust the height of preset selection boxes.
- Fixed global scaling issues.
- Fixed shenanigans with certain UI elements when moving between tabs.
**Known Issues:**
- Loaded lighting presets are not reflected in the game UI. Updating the game UI will reset certain values, like light color and type. (v0.2.0.0)
- Loading a first person preset while in third person, and vice versa, requires double-clicking.
