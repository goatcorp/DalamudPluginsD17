Available for testing:
- Implemented preset importing/exporting.
 - By default, imported presets keep their original creation date. This can be changed in the settings tab, to help with sorting.
 - Share your studio setups!
- More minor tweaks and fixes.
 - Like being able to create presets with duplicate names. Not sure how this bug survived for as long as it did.
 - Error messages have been moved to the chat log.
- First major release (Still starting at the testing branch though!)
