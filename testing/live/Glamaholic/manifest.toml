**Bug Fixes**
None at this time.

**New Features**
- Separated Eorzea Collection features into a new menu.
- Eorzea Collection imports are now automatically tagged as such.
- Added the option to try a glamour on directly from EC without having to create a plate first.
- Began support for interop with other plugins. Plugin interop features will only display if supported plugins are installed and enabled.

For troubleshooting, please enable Troubleshooting mode (Settings -> Troubleshooting mode), reproduce the issue, then post any log line from `/xllog` starting with `[Troubleshooting]`. Thanks!
