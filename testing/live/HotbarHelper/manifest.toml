**HotbarHelper (initial release)**
- Searches your hotbars as you use them for missing actions and useful actions like Limit Break
- Particularly useful if you've lost your hotbars or regularly switch between platforms and find actions are missing
- Ability to ignore actions you may have in macros (such as Raise)

Future versions will include support for DoH and DoL classes.
