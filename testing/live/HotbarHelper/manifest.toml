**HotbarHelper (initial release)**
- Searches your hotbars as you use them for missing actions and useful actions like Limit Break
- Particularly useful if you've lost your hotbars or regularly switch between platforms and find actions are missing
- Ability to ignore actions you may have in macros (such as Raise)

DoH and DoL classes will be supported in a future release.
