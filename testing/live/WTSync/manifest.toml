- Added a button to force WTSync to re-submit your current status to the server, in case your party members aren't seeing your status correctly.
- Fixed the WTSync interface not opening if you're riding someone else's mount while using the option to Open with Wondrous Tails.
- Changed some layout code to work better with different font and style settings, which will hopefully fix an issue with the settings window growing infinitely.
