changelog = """
This should be the last testing release before pushing this to stable, unless any bugs are found.

- Added setting to hide the server info bar entry when in a non-matching duty.
- Start polling for Wondrous Tails status changes when in Idyllshire to update a person's status if they interact with Khloe and do not then open their Wondrous Tails UI.
- Fixed issue where game state was being incorrectly read on the main thread during plugin initialization.
