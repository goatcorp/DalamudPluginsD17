Sorry for the double commit I made a small error.

• Added Settings window;
• Moved Auto Refresh for venue list into settings
• Added 24hr toggle for those who complained about 12hr
• Cleaned up some code
• Verified that UTC Time converstion worked based on local time not submitted time so people don't show up to closed venues.

• Venue submission with character‑verified player tokens
• Live venue list with refresh and sorting
• Stable identity model using ContentId
• Cloudflare Worker backend with rate‑limited endpoints
• Clean UI for browsing and posting venues
