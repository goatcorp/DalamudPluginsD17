**Fantasy Player has returned!**
Thanks to BiscuitUmU for letting me take over :)
No new features, just updated to support the current version of Dalamud.
I've tested as much as I can though I don't have Spotify premium so please let me know if you run into any issues with that.

Feature Requests: Feel free to submit them to the FantasyPlayer github, though I can't guarantee they'll all be looked at in a timely manner.
