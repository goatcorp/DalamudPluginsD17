# Umbra 2.1.5

## New additions

### Copying and pasting widget instances

You can now copy all settings of a widget instance to your clipboard and paste them into another instance of the same
widget type from the settings window of the widget. The paste button will appear disabled if there is no valid data in
your clipboard for that particular widget type.

You can also create new widgets from the clipboard data from the "Add widget" window. This also allows you to share
specific widget instance settings with other people, should you wish to do so.

### Sound Effects

This version introduces a new feature to play sound effects when opening and closing widgets, as well as windows. You
can configure these sound effects, or turn them off completely in the new "Sound Settings" category in the General
Settings tab section.

### Other additions in this version

- Added an option to the Inventory Space indicator to show remaining space instead of occupied space.
- Added an option to show/hide plugins that appear in the Plugin List widget.
- Added an option to show/hide map names in the Teleport widget, making the popup more condensed and taking up less space.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Fixed an issue in which the Weather Forecast widget would vibrate in certain conditions.
- Fixed an issue that caused popups to open when right-clicking a widget.
- Fixed an issue that caused icons on gearset buttons to scale improperly.
- Updated the drawing library for some minor performance improvements.
