# Umbra 2.1.7

## New additions

The Custom Menu widget has received the following additions:

- Added an option to inverse the order of menu entries.
- Added an option that determines whether the menu should close when an entry has been clicked.
- Added an option to control the priority of item quality for item-mode buttons.
- Added a "Separator" menu item type to the Custom Menu entry with support for labels. Note that this functions as a "group", meaning that items below this are part of this group. This is noticeable when reversing the order of items.

### Other additions in this version

- Added a tooltip to the experience bar widget that shows the exact current and required experience, as well as remaining rested points.
