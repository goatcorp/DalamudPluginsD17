## Umbra 2.1.3

### Updated Gearset Switcher

The gearset switcher has been updated. It now supports more icon types, shows an experience bar for jobs that are not
max level and now has context menus for each gearset. The context menus allow you to quickly change the gearset name,
apply glamour plates, quick access to the portrait editor and more.

#### Important Changes

- The buttons to move and delete gearsets have been removed from the header and are now available in the context menu
  for each gearset. Simply right-click on a gearset to access the context menu.

- Due to the fact that there are now 11 gearset icon types to choose from, instead of the default and alternate ones,
  the gearset icons have been reset to the "Default" icon. Please open the gearset switcher configuration and select the
  icon type you want for the toolbar button, header and gearset buttons.

- We've received numerous reports of people not seeing all of their gearsets in the popup, because it was not obvious
  that the role lists can be scrolled through. The gearset switcher now has an _option_ that allows toggling the
  scrolling behavior, which is now _disabled by default_ so people new to the plugin don't get confused about this again.
  If you wish to keep using the scrolling behavior, please enable the option in the Gearset Switcher settings. It's the
  first option under the "Popup Menu Options" category.

### Fixes & Improvements

- The context menus can no longer be moved around.
- Opening the widget instance settings of a Custom Menu widget should no longer crash.
- The drawing library has been updated to the latest version for improved performance and stability.
- Fixed a crash that occured when using the saddlebags for the Inventory Space widget during duties.
- Fixed Items in the Custom Menu only taking normal quality items
- Fixed Key items not being able to be used from the Custom Menu
