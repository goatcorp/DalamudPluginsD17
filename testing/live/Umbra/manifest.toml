# Umbra 3.0.9 (Testing)

This is likely the last version before going to stable, unless other pressing issues come up during testing.
If you found any pressing issues that haven't been reported, please drop by on [Umbra's Discord server](https://discord.gg/xaEnsuAhmm) and let us know.

## New additions

- Added a simple Phantom Job switcher widget.

## Fixes & Improvements

- Hide treasure chest markers as soon as the original game icon starts fading out rather than when the object itself despawns. (by [Haselnussbomber](https://github.com/Haselnussbomber)).
- Close the teleport widget popup after clicking a teleport destination. (By [Bloodsoul](https://github.com/Bloodsoul)).
- Visually hide the "Random Job" button in the Gearset Switcher widget popup while using a DoH/DoL job. (By [Bloodsoul](https://github.com/Bloodsoul)).
- Added an option to the Volume Widget that lets you customize _what_ to mute/unmute when right-clicking the icon on the toolbar.
- Added an option to the Teleport widget that lets you define a fixed width of the destination menu when using the condensed layout.
