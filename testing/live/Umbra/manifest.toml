# Umbra 3.0.0

Umbra 3 is a major release that introduces several new features, improvements,
and bug fixes. This release focuses on enhancing the user experience, improving
performance, and *finally* adding the long-awaited support for multiple
toolbars.

Umbra has seen tons of updates over the course of its development, which has
resulted in a lot of duplicated code and translation strings. Many widgets
share similar features, like customizable icons or text positioning, but almost
every widget had its own implementation of these features. This update has
unified all widgets under a common base, resulting in a more coherent interface
for you and significantly less code to maintain for contributors.

Functionality-wise, not much has changed. Umbra still works the same way as it
did before, but every graphical-aspect of the plugin has been rewritten from
the ground up.

Upon installing this version, you will be greeted with a new quick-start
installer in which you can choose to either keep your current toolbar
configuration, or start anew with an updated default profile.

### Important note for existing users

Some of the widget settings have changed, and some have been removed entirely.
This means that you may need to reconfigure some of your widgets after
installing this update. One of the most notable things that require your
attention is custom icons in widgets, which have most likely been reverted
back to a default icon.

I've tried my best to keep breaking changes to a minimum, but unfortunately,
some were inevitable.

## New Features

### Multiple Toolbars

The long-awaited support for multiple toolbars is finally here! You can now
create an unlimited number of auxiliary toolbars, each with its own set of
widgets. The settings interface to manage the main and auxiliary toolbars
has been completely redesigned to make it easier to manage them.

* You can now drag widgets to sort them within a toolbar, as well as drag them
  between columns in the main toolbar.
* You can now double-click a widget to quickly open its settings window.

### New icon customization

Widgets that support customizable icons now allow you to pick from
different icon types: Game icons, Font Awesome, Text Glyphs, and Bitmap icons.
Double-clicking an icon in the icon picker window will now select the icon.

### New settings interface

The settings interface has been completely redesigned to make it easier to
navigate. It is now much easier to create custom themes, simply by setting
4 dominant colors.

### Graphical updates

Umbra's drawing system has seen a significant overhaul, resulting in better
performance and adding a couple of notable features: Subpixel rendering, a new
layout engine, and support for hairline strokes. The latter eliminates
graphical glitches where thin borders suddenly appear to be gone or 2px
wide. Rounded corners now also appear as actual antialiased rounded corners.

The new layout engine also allows for much more complex layouts without the
need to manually compute the positions and size of elements on every frame.
This results in _much better performance_ in complex widgets like the Gearset
switcher or the settings window.
