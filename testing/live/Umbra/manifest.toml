# Umbra 2.1.4

## New additions

### Quick Access to Widget Settings

As you might have noticed, editing widget instance settings can become a bit cumbersome if you
always have to open the Umbra Settings window, find the widget, open it and click the cog icon.
Continuously doing this can take up quite some time.

You can now enable **Widget Quick Setting Access** which allows you to immediately access the
settings window of individual widgets by holding `control` + `shift` and `right-click` the
widget on the toolbar.

> Note that some widgets that are normally not interactive _may_ show highlight effects when your
> mouse cursor is over them while this option is enabled. If this bothers you, simply disable the
> quick access setting after you're done editing.

You can find this setting under `General Settings` -> `Toolbar Settings`.
