1.0.0.0

The Stable Release of TooltipNotes! 

This is a plugin which allows you to put custom notes onto item tooltips easily by rightclicking.

Want to reuse notes between items? 
Sure! just use the label feature to make generich notes

Dont have the item and thus can rightclick it?
Just hover over the item in a way that generates a tooltip and then type /tnnote to bring up the notewindow for that item!

Do you have many rings with the same name that belong to different job BIS?
No Problem! enable glamour specific notes in the config and glamour one of your rings(onto itself is fine) and boom seperate notes!

If you are in any need for support please enable Debug logging in the plugin config 
and head on over to the Tooltip Notes channel in the plguin-help-forum over in the Discord
