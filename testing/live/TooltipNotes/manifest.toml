0.1.2.1
## Feature
Commands! you can now use /tnconfig to open the config and /tnnote to open a note window based on the last hovered item (this should include all scenarios in which items produce a tooltip)
A new Window! by typing /tnallnotes you can open a window which shows you all your notes in one window. Currently this is pretty useless but in the future I hope to make it so that you can use this to edit all notes at once rather than one by one.
