Specific status icons now take priority over job icons.
- In a duty, the following icons are prioritized: Disconnecting, Viewing Cutscene, and Idle
- Outside of a duty, the following icons are prioritized: Disconnecting, Viewing Cutscene, Busy, Idle, Duty Finder, Party Leader, Party Member, and Role Playing
