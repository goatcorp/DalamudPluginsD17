- For chat names, added the ability to toggle role colors on/off by context (overworld, dungeon, raid, etc.) (Thanks AkazaRenn)
- Fixed a bug where having a pet out during an alliance raid caused party numbers to not appear
- Reduced log output of the plugin
- Second pass refactor. I haven't broken anything yet!
