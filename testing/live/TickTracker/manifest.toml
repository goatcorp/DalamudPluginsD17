changelog = """
- Reworked...everything?
- Tick progress is tracked more consistently
- Lists of Status IDs that can trigger faster ticks or halt regen altogether of mana / hp are now automatically generated
- Added a new option to hide the respective bars when hp or mp is full
- Disabled in PvP instances. It still works in Wolves' Den, but not while in the duel area.
- Added a debug window for ease of access to the generated lists
