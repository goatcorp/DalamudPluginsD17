changelog = """Version 0.0.1.8
- Some changes on opcodes.
- New feature: now it's possible to check the score (and the total data/calculation to get there) from previous floor sets by clicking on the floor set label (now buttons) on the Summary page (Statistics Window).
A (customizable) color will be applied to the data being changed; only 3 sections of the Summary page should be changed: the score calculation section, the Total section, and the Last Floor section.
