changelog = """
- Added a new menu: Boss Status Timer (accessed through the Statistics Window). 
- A new tab and an entry on the General tab > Information have been added for this menu.
- In this menu, you can see your buffs duration and the boss's debuffs duration through a timeline.
- This new feature still needs some more testing on a variety of bosses (especially when applying debuffs such as vulnerability up stacks and enervation).
