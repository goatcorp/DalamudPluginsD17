- Lots of UI adjustments and improvements on the summary page, where it shows the floor set scores, times, and calculations (Statistics Window).
- Added mouse wheel support for the backup file list (Main Window).
- The maps icon on the floor set (Statistics Window) will now always be shown for each floor. In cases of partial map exploration, a darker color will be applied to the map icon, indicating no map reveal bonus.
- The Main Window-related configuration from the General tab was moved to the Main tab (reconfiguration may be required).
