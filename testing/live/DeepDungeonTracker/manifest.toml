changelog = """Version 0.0.3.0
- Eureka Orthos initial support.

Version 0.0.2.0
- [*Breaking Changes*] All save files up to this version need to be converted (go to the Statistics Tab and scroll down to [Convert Save Utility] section for more details).
- Added the [Convert Save Utility] section on the Statistics Tab.
- Added a date and time stamp to the file name when creating backup files (avoid overwriting files).
- Added a delete confirmation dialog before deleting a backup file (avoid misclick).
- Pomanders (Got and Used) in the Total section (Statistics Window) will now be automatically sorted (better visualization).

- Added some font customization for Tracker and Score Window.
- The /ddtload command will now close the Statistics Window if it is open.

Version 0.0.1.8

- New feature: now it's possible to check the score (and the total data/calculation to get there) from previous floor sets by clicking on the floor set label (now buttons) on the Summary page (Statistics Window).
A (customizable) color will be applied to the data being changed; only 3 sections of the Summary page should be changed: the score calculation section, the Total section, and the Last Floor section.
