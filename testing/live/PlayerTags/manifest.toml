Hello everyone!

This update has a few new feature (such job icons, chat type selection) and some other changes.

First of all, thanks to everyone using Player Tags, everyone that helped me when I had dummy questions, thanks to the creator of Party Icons who allowed me to reuse some logic from his Plugin for the new library combined with code from Player Tags, and also thanks to r00telement (the original creator of this plugin) for the brilliant idea and for the creation.

Now, let's come to this update...
There has been moved some code to a separated library in another repository for general use for everyone. There are more plans for that library especially for the nameplate features. Also, everyone is free to review it and add his own codes via PRs.

- New features:
    - Tags: Added Job Icons
        - Choose what icon set you want to use
        - This is the first version of it, like you may know from Party Icons, that replaces the status icon.
        - By default there are some settings for priorizing status icons over job icons (you can edit them in the settings)
        - The plan for the future is to extend that feature and implement the ability to add a second icon beside the status icon.
    - Tags: Added Tag configuration templates
    - Tags: Choose for what chat type the Tag should applied to
    - General: Gray out or completely ignore Tags for dead players
- Other:
    - A lot minor adjustments and fixes, i don't remember yet
- Under the hood:
    - Use new config file at \"\\pluginConfig\\Player Tags\\Config.json\" (with auto migration)
    - Move a lot of code more standardised to a library (available on GitHub)

Now, as you can see, there are bigger changes this time. It requires some public testing, as for me it works:TM: and for general use I do not need all the features, only a part of them.
So, now I ask you all to help me testing the new version! If you find any bugs or have an idea how to make it better, let me know please!
Check out the \"Player Tags\" forum on Discord or create an issue on the GitHub repo.

I haven't a lot of knowledge with ImGui, so if you find any bad code or breaking things, let me know!

There are new Strings that are waiting for translation. Feel free to help!

Wish you all a good start to the weekend, enjoy it!
