Version 0.11.0.0:
- Upgrade to API12
- ⚠️Experimental Release.
- Removed native integrations and native Dll loading, should minimize potential crashes and isolate the game from instability.
- Built-in standalone server: Tracker integrations are now handled via an child process, automatically managed by the plugin.
    - To achieve this, the plugin has been given an entrypoint and turned into an AspNet Web project, it can now both be loaded by Dalamud as a Plugin, or run within Dotnet (or via its accompanying .exe) as the Server.
    - The server automatically starts and stops as needed, and it will also terminate itself if 10 seconds pass with no active connections.

Known Issues:
- Windowed mode is currently unsupported.
- Some entities are not returning to normal after being highlighted by raycast detection.
- Entities highlighted by proximity are not returning to normal after no longer being the closest.
