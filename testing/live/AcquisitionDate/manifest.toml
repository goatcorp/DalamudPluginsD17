    [0.1.1.0]
    Added smaller alias commands				(Typing hard)
    The acquiry window now shows what character is active	(You can log out and still acquire data for your last logged in character; this is to combat loading screens ruining this feature. It was VERY unclear who you were collecting data for however)
    More forgiving Session Token Entry				(People mentioned that having leading or trailing whitespaces made the session token not work. This makes that more forgiving.)
    More UI Warnings/Tips					(This is because I regularly hear acquiring data using a VPN does NOT work)
    You can now set the delay between requests. 		(This is to combat excessive cancelled queues if your internet is slightly slow. (Will never go below 1.5 seconds))
    The Debug Window now shows all acquired data in a list 	(This is a preview of what the upcoming Date List will behave like, I just need it to be tested early)
