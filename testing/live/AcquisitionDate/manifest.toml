 [0.2.0.0]
- Fixes downloads not working.
- Build the system around parsers instead of parsing directly in web requests.
- Language based date formatting
- Now shows if a date is the earliest date and potetially not accurate or could be acquired before a given date.
- Downloads now parse the pages language instead of asuming the page language.
- Downloads should be more stable in general.

! The plugin is undergoing majour reworks which had to be pushed earlier than I expected.
! You should see no issues but there's a lot of ""framework"" and unused code in this update.
