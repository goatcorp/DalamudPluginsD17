changelog = "Updated the LapCatCounter plugin to version 1.20.0. Fixed a bug where comfig resets emote ID's to 0 and doesnt track laps. Adjusted cooldown for time between laps counted to 30 seconds to prevent spamming the same lap or accidental counts from movement. ADded a tiem tracker for how long you sat in someone's lap per person, total time in laps, and max time spent on a single lap in one go."
