Who's Talking v0.1.0.0: See Discord voice activity indicators directly on your party list.

This is the first release! Please give it a go and see if you can break it :)

Requirements:
- a Discord client (not the web version) running on the same machine as XIV
- Discord nicknames that *roughly* match XIV character names (full name preferred, but first or last name is fine, and case doesn't matter)
