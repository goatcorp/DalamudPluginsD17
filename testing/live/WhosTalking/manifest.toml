**Version 0.7.1.0**

- Fix scrolling of preview icons in settings window (thanks to @foophoof for the report)
- Add option for non-rounded voice activity indicators, useful for users of certain graphical mods (thanks to iris for the implementation)

**Known issue:** the native UI indicators are invisible with certain graphical mods. This will be resolved in a future update. In the meantime, users experiencing this issue can head to the plugin settings and switch "indicator style" to "Imgui".
