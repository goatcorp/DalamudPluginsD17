**Version 0.6.8.0**

Some minor UI changes, and a fix that's meant to prevent a hypothetical memory leak in Discord – Who's Talking will no longer periodically reconnect to Discord just because it didn't see anything happening for a while.

If you notice that Who's Talking stops displaying voice statuses at any point (for example, if you quit Discord and reopen it while the game is open), please let me know!

A reminder: **please ping @sersorrel when asking questions or reporting bugs** – I have #plugins-general muted and will not see your message otherwise.
