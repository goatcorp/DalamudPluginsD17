**Version 0.7.0.0**

Adds support for rendering voice activity indicators with the game's native UI toolkit!

This means that you can drag game windows on top of the party list, and the indicators will be properly rendered below the overlapping window.

To test this new feature, head to the plugin settings and switch "indicator style" from "Imgui" to "Atk". Please let me know about any problems via the new Who's Talking thread in #plugin-help-forum.
