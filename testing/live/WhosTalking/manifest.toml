**Version 0.7.2.0**

- Fix plugin ignoring group DMs, for real this time (thanks to Asriel for the report)

**Known issue:** the native UI indicators are invisible with certain graphical mods. This will be resolved in a future update. In the meantime, users experiencing this issue can head to the plugin settings and switch "indicator style" to "Imgui".
