- Added text commands to modify plugin settings via chat/macros
- Set up IPC for integration with other plugins
- Prepped plugin text for translation

This should be one of the last testing updates before the plugin moves over to stable. Be sure to send feedback if you run into any bugs I ought to squash! Lotsa thanks!
