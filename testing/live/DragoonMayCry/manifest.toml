- The time window used to determine if a GCD is dropped or clipped is now configurable. This will not affect how the final rank is calculated.
- Added modifiers for Astrologian, Bard, Scholar, Sage and White Mage :
    - Refreshing DoTs before they fade will grants points to the style meter
    - Using AST cards, Scholar's energy drain, Sage's addersgall, and WHM lilies will also grant points to the meter.
More info about those modifiers in the 'How it works' window.
