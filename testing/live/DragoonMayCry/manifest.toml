    - Dynamic BGM wouldn't start if you entered a non PvP instance from the wolve's den pier
    - The game's BGM wouldn't unmute if you disabled dynamic BGM inside an instance
    - Changing the OS audio default output device will now redirect sound to the new output instead of playing on the old one
