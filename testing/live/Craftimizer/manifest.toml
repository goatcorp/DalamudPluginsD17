changelog = """
Big solver generation fixes! *It now tries super duper hard to get to 100% HQ!*

New features:
- Recipes without a need for quality will prioritize only step count
- Minor UI tweaks

Fixed bugs:
- Solver gives a subpar macro when 100% HQ is clearly possible
- Small off-by-1 errors with progress/quality calculations
- Normal stepwise algorithm never finishes
